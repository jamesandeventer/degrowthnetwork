We suggest that work to date has focused on the effects of improvements in transport technologies, changes in the price of transport, physical infrastructure provision, behavioural change and alternative institutional arrangements for governing transport systems. In terms of research methodologies, positivist and quantitative analysis prevails, although there are signs of experimentation with non-positivist epistemologies and participatory methods. These particular engagements with climate change mitigation reflect mutually reinforcing tendencies within and beyond the academic transport community. We first draw on a revised version of Thomas Kuhn's philosophy of science to explore the path dependencies within transport studies, which are at least partly responsible for the predisposition towards quantitative modelling and technology, pricing and infrastructure oriented interventions in transport systems. We then employ the governmentality perspective to examine how transport academics' engagements with climate change mitigation depend on and align with more general understandings of climate change in UK society and beyond. The analysis makes clear that ecological modernisation and neo-liberal governmentality more generally provide the context for the current focus on and belief in technological, behaviour change, and especially market-based mitigation strategies. While current research trajectories are important and insightful, we believe that a deeper engagement with theoretical insights from the social sciences will produce richer understandings of transport mitigation in transport and briefly outline some of the contributions thinking on socio-technical transitions and practice theories can make. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Behaviour change;

This requires that the developed countries' emissions are radically reduced during the next 40 years. Energy scenario studies provide insights on the societal transitions that might be implied by such low-carbon futures, and in this paper we discuss how a greater attention to different governance and institutional issues can complement future scenario exercises. The analysis is based on a critical review of 20 quantitative and qualitative scenario studies, all of relevance for meeting long-term climate policy objectives. The paper: (a) analyzes some key differences in energy technology mixes and primary energy use patterns across these studies; (b) briefly explores the extent and the nature of the societal challenges and policy responses implied; and (c) discusses a number of important implications for the design and scope of future scenario studies. Our review shows that in previous scenario studies the main attention is typically paid to analyzing the impact of well-defined and uniform policy instruments, while fewer studies factor in the role of institutional change in achieving different energy futures. We therefore point towards a number of strategies of integrating issues of transition governance into future scenario analyses, and argue for a closer synthesis of qualitative and quantitative scenario building. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy scenarios; Low-carbon society; Transition governance","carbon emission; emission inventory; energy policy; energy use; environmental policy; future prospect; governance approach; institutional reform; integrated approach; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis",,,,,,"Åkerman, J., Isaksson, K., Johansson, J., Hedberg, L., (2007), Tvågradersmålet i sikte? - Scenarier för det svenska energi- och transportsystemet till år 2050, Report 5754.

In particular, the present paper focuses on the 'gold' tesserae, i.e., tesserae with a metal foil, usually composed of gold, and characterised by transparent glass not deliberately coloured or decolourised. The main research aims were the identification of the 'base composition' of the glass used for mosaics and the reconstruction of production techniques. In addition, comparisons with major compositional groups identified in the literature allowed us to contextualise Paduan 'gold' tesserae in the wider context of glass production in the 6th century AD. The compositional characterisation of Paduan 'gold' tesserae, carried out by means of EMPA and LA-ICP-MS analyses, showed that most of the glass samples were obtained with natron as flux, although the coexistence of various production technologies and the extent of recycling, which confirm the 6th century AD as a period of technological transition, are documented. Identification of some soda ash tesserae also allowed us to attest Medieval restoration operations. The good match between compositional groups identified in the literature for glass vessels and compositional groups identified in the 'gold' tesserae suggests technological links between these two production types. The chemical similarity between 'gold' tesserae from Ravenna and some from Padova also links production technologies in these two towns during the 6th century; coupled with the results of the historical-artistic study, these factors provide further evidence to the hypothesis that the Paduan production was mainly influenced by the nearby city of Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine mosaics in Italy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","EMPA; Glass; Gold tesserae; LA-ICP-MS; Padova; Palaeo-Christian mosaic; Production technology",,,,,,,"Aerts, A., Velde, B., Janssens, K., Dijkman, W., Change in silica source in Roman and post-Roman glass (2003) Spectrochimica Acta Part B, 58, pp. 659-667; Andreescu-Treadgold, I., Henderson, J., Roe, M., (2006) Glass from the mosaics on the west wall of Torcello Basilica.

They are entrenched, materially and socio-institutionally, and seem to be 'locked-in'. Scholars have addressed this problem by, for example, devising strategies for de-entrenchment, alternative path creation and transition management that focus on the process of change (emphasis on 'how'). In this paper, we take a novel and counterintuitive approach, and focus on standards as a starting point for change (emphasis on 'what'). We analyze in what manner standards can play a catalyzing role in infrastructure transitions and which standards characteristics facilitate in doing so.Central to our framework are the concepts of gateway technology and compatibility. We analyze three cases, i.e., the modal shift in freight container transport; the transition from barcode to Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID); and the possibility of a Dutch energy transition from natural gas to hydrogen.The article concludes that standards can catalyze infrastructure transitions if, first, their content well-reflects relevant stakeholder interests; and, second, if standard specifications are simple and performance-oriented. Their impact is highest in stable markets and for expanding infrastructures. Under these conditions standards can exploit the forces of entrenchment and socio-technical lock-in to bring about change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"infrastructural development; management; stakeholder; standard (reference)",,,,,,"Kaijser, A., Striking bonanza.

The demand of natural resources, renewable and non-renewable, is a crucial aspect of environmental (un-) sustainability. When considering a societal transition scheme towards sustainability, bio-based options come to the fore. The article develops a global framework for the analysis of natural resource demand of global biofuels. The framework defines the biofuel system in terms of exergy at four levels, i.e., the foreground system, the supply chain, the anthroposphere, and the ecosphere. Various measures of resource demand, such as cumulative exergy demand, global and anthropogenic exergy budgets are incorporated into the framework. Based on reviews of global biofuel production and natural resource demand of the anthroposphere, the study finds that the production of conventional biofuels, i.e., first generation of biodiesel and bioethanol by key producer countries in 2008 consumed 9.32 E+11 MJ of exergy from non-renewable resources and accounted for 0.23% of the total anthropogenic non-renewable resource demand. In addition, it shows that the contribution to climate change due to the heat emission of the global biofuel production was 5.79 E-05 W/m2, which would reach up to 0.002% of global greenhouse warming if anthropogenic heat flux is treated as a climate forcing. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It is firstly argued that the theories of technology, as distinguished by Feenberg, cannot adequately explain the different interpretations of the role of technology in the transition towards sustainability, as Paredis argues. Secondly, the basic argument of Paredis is countered that transition research is fundamentally handicapped by its constructivists roots to discriminate between options. Finally it is argued that a third strand of transition research exists that is explicitly interventionist, and that nurtures specific technology in context. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Constructivism; Substantivism; Sustainability; Technology; Transition management; Transition research",,,,,,,,"Bos, A.P.; Livestock Research, Wageningen UR, P.O.

Moreover, smarter technologies/systems are needed. And in this ever more complex, interconnected, and uncertain world, smarter policymaking in the energy field is certainly needed too. After all, current energy policymaking still mainly ignores (dynamic) complexity and (deep) uncertainty. This paper illustrates two model-based approaches for supporting policymaking for complex and uncertain issues as well as their combination. First, Exploratory System Dynamics Modeling and Analysis allows exploring and analyzing millions of plausible (uncertain) dynamic system behaviors and testing the robustness of policies. This approach is illustrated by means of a System Dynamics simulation model related to energy grid investments. Second, Experiential Model-Based Gaming allows policymakers to experience dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty, and helps them feel the need to embrace both in policymaking. Before having experienced different plausible futures, almost all high-level managers and highly-educated students that played such experiential games applied inappropriate strategies in most plausible futures played, and hence failed in the face of uncertainty. Failing repeatedly actually prepared them for thinking outside their old/reactive/predictive modes in subsequent bounce-casting sessions. Exploratory System Dynamics Modeling and Analysis and Experiential Model-Based Gaming may also be mutually beneficial: most subjects only acknowledge the need to take uncertainty and dynamic complexity seriously into account after having participated in experience-oriented gaming sessions. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Current energy; Dynamic complexity; Energy fields; Energy systems; Grid investment; Model based approach; Policy makers; Policy making; System dynamics modeling; System dynamics simulation; Transition management; Computer simulation; Industrial management; Investments; System theory; Technology; Uncertainty analysis; Mathematical models",,,,,,"Senge, P., (1990) The Ffth Discipline: The Art and Prctice of the Learing Organization, p. 424; Sterman, J., The 2001 Jay W.

In the present paper, the combination of archaeological, chemical and textural data allows us to identify production technologies in a time-interval perceived to be a period of technological transition for glass. In particular, the frequent occurrence of recycled natron glass and only a few glass samples made with soda plant ash indicate that recycling of earlier glass was common in inland Northern Italy in the 10th-11th centuries AD. In addition, blue and reticello decorations were obtained by recycling earlier glass mosaic tesserae, as shown by much Co, Cu, Sn, Sb and Pb and the presence of crystallised calcium antimonates. A few glass samples with chemical compositions intermediate between natron and soda plant ash glass were also identified, suggesting a gradual change in glass composition from natron-based towards soda ash-based production technology, which prevailed in the 13th-14th centuries. In conclusion, the difficulty in describing mid-Medieval glass as a well-defined entity, due to the great propensity for recycling earlier glass samples which causes variability in chemical compositions, particularly those of trace elements, is clearly documented here. In any case, this paper contributes to a new type of chrono-typological scanning and to more detailed knowledge of glass production technology during mid-Medieval times in Northern Italy, little found in the literature until now. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Glass; Mid-Medieval times; Nogara; Production technology; Recycling","archaeology; chemical composition; glass; industrial technology; Medieval; productivity; recycling; Italy",,,,,,"Barkoundah, Y., Henderson, J., Plant ashes from Syria and the manufacture of ancient glass: ethnographic and scientific aspects (2006) Journal of Glass Studies, 48, pp. 297-321; Barrera, J., Velde, B., A study of French Medieval glass composition (1989) Archéologie Médiévale, 19, pp. 81-130; Baumgartner, E., Krueger, I., (1988) Phönix aus sand und asche.

Past research largely omitted co-agency in transition-related activities between adolescents and their parents, which could be described in terms of self- and other-regulation. The present pilot study examined adolescents' and mothers' career-specific regulatory behaviors as perceived from both agents' perspectives. 38 German adolescents rated importance and engagement in one transition-related personal goal and reported on intensity of career exploration activities. Furthermore, they reported on their perceptions of mothers' career-related behaviors and confidence in their offspring's transition management. All measures were also assessed from the mothers' point of view. Results revealed associations within and across family members' ratings that showed similarities as well as differences in perceptions of how behaviors associate. Partial correlation analyses showed that specific maternal behavior not contingent upon her general warmth associated with child behavior. © 2010 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.","Career exploration; Co-development; Maternal confidence; Maternal support; Personal goals","adult; article; career planning; child behavior; female; human; human experiment; male; maternal behavior; normal human; perception; pilot study; questionnaire",,,,,,"Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, , Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ; Dietrich, J., Kracke, B., Career-specific parental behaviors in adolescents' development (2009) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 75 (2), pp. 109-119; (2007) Berufsbildungsbericht 2007, , http://www.bibb.de/dokumente/pdf/BBB2007.pdf, Available from:, Retrieved April 4, 2010, Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Heckhausen, J., (1999) Developmental regulation in adulthood: Age-normative and sociostructural constraints as adaptive challenges, , Cambridge University Press, New York, NY; Jussim, L., Social perceptions and social reality: a reflection-construction model (1991) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98, pp. 54-73; Kenny, D.A., Cook, W., Partner effects in relationship research: conceptual issues, analytic difficulties, and illustrations (1999) Personal Relationships, 6, pp. 433-448; Kracke, B., Parental behaviors and adolescents' career exploration (1997) Career Development Quarterly, 45 (4), pp. 341-350; Kramer, S.H., Rosenthal, R., Effect sizes and significance levels in small-sample research (1999) Statistical strategies for small sample research, pp. 60-81. , Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA, R.H.

The transition management approach is a cyclical process built upon a multilevel perspective of technology transitions. There is also a growing body of research on systems engineering for sustainability, but the field remains focused in areas such as indicators or metrics for sustainability, optimization of design and/or selection decisions and processes, or techniques for evaluation of various projects or proposals, with limited research being conducted directly on the role of systems engineering within TM. This paper discusses the potential for systems engineering application within TM and presents a specific example of a system engineering application developed for use in TM implementation efforts. Requirements for an architecture framework to support a portfolio of TM projects were developed based on a comprehensive literature review. Based on these requirements, an overview and discussion of a Transition Management Portfolio Architecture Framework is presented. Initial results show the need for, and the application of a large body of literature to, such a framework. Further research will include further specification of the architecture framework design as well as validation utilizing a case study of a portfolio of transition projects. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Architecture frameworks; Engineering applications; Engineering methodology; Literature reviews; Selection decisions; Sustainable technology; Technology transition; Transition management; Architecture; Industrial management; Research; Sustainable development; Systems engineering; Technology",,,,,,"Rotmans, J., (2000) Transitions & Transition Management: For A Low Emission Energy Supply, A Study for the 4th National Environmental Policy Plan (NMP4), , International Centre for Integrated Assessment & Sustainable Development October; Kemp, R., Transition management as a model for managing processes of co-evolution towards sustainable development (2007) International Journal of Sustainable Development & World Ecology, 14, pp. 78-91; Schot, J., Geels, F.W., Strategic niche management and sustainable innovation journeys: Theory, findings, research agenda, and policy (2008) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 20, pp. 537-554. , September; Geels, F.W., Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: A multi-level perspective and a case study (2002) Research Policy, 31, pp. 1257-1274; Raven, R., Niche accumulation and hybridisation strategies in transition processes towards a sustainable energy system: An assessment of differences and pitfalls (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 2390-2400; Geels, F.W., (2005) Technological Transitions and System Innovations: A Co-Evolutionary and Socio-Technical Analysis, , Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc; Geels, F., Schot, J., Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways (2007) Research Policy, 36, pp. 399-417; Kemp, R., Rotmans, J., Managing the transition to sustainable mobility (2004) System Innovation and the Transition to Sustainability: Theory, Evidence, and Policy, pp. 137-167. , B.

The notable exception is transition management. However, both social construction of technology and transition management have been criticized as ignoring distributions of power in society, and for not offering guidance in the choice of the most sustainable technologies. The reviewer criticizes this approach: the issue is not to choose the right technologies, but to address the root causes of unsustainability in society. In addition to politization of transition management the reviewer argues that strong visions are necessary to lead the way.

It will be argued that durable and capital-intensive assets, together with a high degree of systemness generate considerable inertia and impede fundamental change. At the same time, capital intensity and massive investment needs as well as negative environmental impacts represent sources for change. A high degree of regulation and an often large share of public utilities also play a key role for sector dynamics. Conceptual frameworks for studying infrastructures and making policy recommendations have to take into account these particularities and the close interplay of techno-economic, organizational, and institutional characteristics. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Infrastructure sectors; Large technical systems; Sociotechnical transition","Capital intensity; Conceptual frameworks; Fundamental changes; Infrastructure sector; Key characteristics; Large technical systems; Sociotechnical; Techno-economics; Transformation process; Environmental impact; Public utilities; Water supply; Investments; capital formation; conceptual framework; industrial investment; infrastructural development; institutional framework; organizational framework; regulatory framework; service sector",,,,,,"Archibugi, D., Pavitt's Taxonomy sixteen years on: A review article (2001) Econ.

However, it has mostly taken a sectoral approach which neglects the potential relationships between environmental changes and policy dynamics in different sectors. This paper examines parallel and interrelated dynamics in the Israeli water and energy sectors by combining insights from the literature on policy dynamics, transition management, co-evolution, and policy integration. The developed approach examines how sectoral transitions may be coupled and technological regimes may co-evolve. Israel has battled water, energy and other scarcities from its formation. Consecutive dry years, the loss of stream flows, salinization of the coastal aquifer, and severe pollution are problems facing water managers, while air pollution, imported fossil fuels and carbon emissions are salient energy issues. Water and energy sectors are both in transition because earlier policies have resulted in socially-induced scarcity, degradation of environmental assets and loss of adaptive capacity to respond to future challenges. Current approaches to water and energy scarcities have evolved around technological configurations which emphasize traditional supply side solutions such as seawater desalination and additional power plants. They may be difficult to change without explicit integrative transitions management. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

There also lacks research on the social relations of initiating injecting drug use in transitional society. We draw upon analyses of 42 audio-recorded semi-structured interviews with current and recent injecting drug users, conducted in 2009 in the Republic of Moldova, a transitional society of south-eastern Europe. A thematic analysis informed by narrative theory was undertaken, focusing on accounts of self-initiation and the initiation of others. We also reflect upon the potential of peer efforts to dissuade would-be injectors from initiating. Findings emphasise initiation into injecting as a symbolic identity transition, enabled through everyday social relations. In turn, our analysis locates the drug transitions of the self inside an account of societal transition. We find that personal narratives of self transition are made sense of, and presented, in relation to broader narratives of social transition and change. Furthermore, we explore how narratives of self-initiation, and especially the initiation of others, serve to negotiate initiation as a moral boundary crossing. Self-initiation is located inside an account of transitioning social values. In looking back, initiation is depicted as a feature of a historically situated aberration in normative values experienced by the 'transition generation'. Accounts of the initiation of others (which a third of our sample describe) seek to qualify the act as acceptable given the circumstances. These accounts also connect the contingency of agency with broader narratives of social condition. Lastly, the power of peers to dissuade others from initiating injection was doubted, in part because most self-initiations were accomplished as a product of agency enabled by environment as well as in the face of peer attempts to dissuade. © 2011.","Eastern Europe; Initiation; Injecting; Narrative; Peer intervention; Qualitative; Transition",,,,,,,,"Rhodes, T.; The Centre for Research on Drugs and Health Behaviour, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicinemail: tim.rhodes@lshtm.ac.uk",,,,,,,,09553959,,IJDPE,10.1016/j.drugpo.2011.07.012,,"English","International Journal of Drug Policy",Article in Press,Scopus

This paper postulates that a Systems Thinking approach could address some of the weaknesses of current policies, which include a lack of deep understanding into what really drives energy demand and how to change it at the user level. Several systems analysis tools are reviewed: the energy system can be conceptualized as a sociotechnical regime within a Multi Level Perspective framework, with regime changes a result of landscape pressures; alternatively, subsystems within the demand side system can be classified by problem-context type. Regarding applications of systems methodologies, a case study into the use of systems methods at Sustain Ltd by their low-carbon buildings practice is given. A non-capital approach that combines technology optimization, behavior change, and information feedback is expected to produce quick and low-cost energy savings within a school. © 2011 IEEE.","carbon emissions reduction; energy demand reduction; sociotechnical transitions; systems thinking","Behavior change; Carbon emissions; Demand-side; Energy demands; Energy systems; Information feedback; Low-carbon; Low-cost energy; Multi-level; Socio-technical regimes; Sociotechnical; systems thinking; Technology optimization; User levels; Behavioral research; Cloud computing; Computer systems; Emission control; Energy management; Security of data; System theory; Systems analysis; Systems engineering; Smart power grids",,,,,,"Geels, F.W., Schot, J., Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways (2007) Research Policy, 36 (3), pp. 399-417. , DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2007.01.003, PII S0048733307000248; (2009) The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan: National Strategy for Climate and Energy, , DECC, D. f.

We advocate the application of the chaos mathematical technique of time-varying local Lyapunov exponents to estimate the rates of change, timing of technological transitions and the continuity-discontinuity loop time periods. To illustrate our framework of ideas, we investigated and compared the development of four technologies - semiconductor, display, software, and biotechnology - from 1976 to 2005, using time series patent data.

This paper seeks to answer this question. Design/methodology/approach: To document industry variation in efficiency between priority and non-priority sectors, the paper uses firm-level data collected in 1992 and 1995 to estimate a stochastic frontier production function for 11 industries. It then aims to investigate which firm characteristics contributed to variation in technical efficiency between 1992 and 1995. Findings: Firms in low-priority sectors exhibited higher efficiency in 1992 than firms in high-priority sectors; by 1995, efficiency differences diminish. Efficiency gains were relatively higher in industries which experienced the largest percentage output declines. Non-state ownership tends to improve efficiency, but the ownership effect varies by industry and over time. The paper rejects the hypothesis that export experience increases efficiency, and this result is especially strong in 1995. Location in Moscow proved to be a positive factor, and the benefit grew over time. Research limitations/implications: Panel data were not used because near-hyper-inflationary conditions and changes in capital valuation methods make it impossible to accurately adjust output and capital values between 1992 and 1995; and because firms that divided into multiple units or changed industry classification between 1992 and 1995 would need to be dropped, reducing sample size considerably and making industry-level analysis impossible. Practical implications: The paper provides a baseline for analyzing the impact of the transition on the performance of Russian manufacturing firms. It evaluates the influence of location (capital city effect) on firm performance, and demonstrates that privatization alone is not sufficient to improve efficiency. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the initial impact of transition on the efficiency of Russian firms across 11 industries, with focus on differences between former priority and non-priority sectors. The results underscore the magnitude of structural dislocation caused by planners' preferences in the former Soviet economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Industry differences; Plant efficiency; Russia; Stochastic frontier; Technical efficiency; Transition management",,,,,,,"Aigner, D., Lovell, C., Schmidt, P., Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models (1977) Journal of Econometrics, 6 (1), pp. 21-37; Amann, R., Cooper, J., (1982) Industrial Innovation in the Soviet Union, , Yale University Press, New Haven, CT; Amann, R., Cooper, J., Davies, R., (1977) The Technological Level of Soviet Industry, , Yale University Press, New Haven, CT; Bahry, D., (1987) Outside Moscow: Power, Politics, and Budgetary Policy in the Soviet Republics, , Columbia University Press, New York, NY; Bairam, E., Elasticity of substitution, technical progress and returns to scale in branches of Soviet industry: A new CES production function approach (1991) Journal of Applied Econometrics, 6 (1), pp. 91-96; Battese, G.E., Coelli, T.J., Frontier production functions, technical efficiency and panel data: With applications to paddy farmers in India (1992) Journal of Productivity Analysis, 3 (1-2), pp. 153-169; Battese, G.E., Coelli, T.J., A model for technical inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data (1995) Empirical Economics, 20 (2), pp. 325-332; Berliner, J., (1976) The Innovation Decision in Soviet Industry, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Biznes-Karta, (1995) Biznes-Karta 95: Select Volumes, , Biznes-Karta, Moscow; Brada, J., King, A., Ma, C.Y., Industrial economics of the transition: Determinants of enterprise efficiency in Czechoslovakia and Hungary (1997) Oxford Economic Papers, 49 (1), pp. 104-127; Brainerd, E., Five years later: The impact of mass privatization on wages in Russia, 1993-1996 (2002) Journal of Comparative Economics, 30, pp. 160-190; Brock, G., Inefficiency in Siberia: Some empirical evidence from Irkutsk Province (1993) Economic Systems, 17 (2), pp. 81-96; Brown, D., Earle, J., (2001) Privatization, competition and reform strategies: Evidence from Russian enterprise panel data, , CEPR Discussion Paper, Centre for Economic Policy Research, London; (1993) BusinessMap 92: Russian Industry, 1-18. , Business Information Agency, Business Information Agency, Moscow; Clarke, S., (1996) The Russian Enterprise in Transition, , Edward Elgar, Brookfield, VT; Clarke, S., (1998) Structural Adjustment without Mass Unemployment?

Scholars have explored ways through which configurations of technologies, infrastructures, social practices, institutions and markets can change to fulfil their functions in a more sustainable way. A multi-level perspective (MLP) has been developed to describe and analyse these complex, long-term processes. It has also been used to help design policy for example in the Netherlands. In this paper the MLP is used in a novel way: as a heuristic to ex ante assess policies to stimulate socio-technical transitions. Instead of using it for policy development, the MLP is used here for an assessment of policy. The analysis focuses on a particular policy initiative intended to stimulate the transition to a low carbon economy in the UK: the Carbon Trust. This paper makes two contributions to the socio-technical transitions literature: Conceptually, the paper demonstrates the usefulness of the socio-technical multi-level perspective to analyse policies and assess their likely impact ex ante against the background of theorising about the patterns of large scale, socio-technical change. Empirically, the paper finds that the activities of the Carbon Trust consist of a variety of well targeted ways to stimulate the development of socio-technical niches as well as to change regime practices directly. Nevertheless, the paper argues that this model also faces difficulties in promoting a transition towards a low carbon economy. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The experiment is more generally called a test-bed, which is made possible by Iceland's small society and unique natural environment. Iceland has developed hydrogen energy policies, and corresponding activities have provided researchers with experimental experiences. This paper sheds light on Iceland's challenge from a sociotechnical system viewpoint, which emphasizes the importance of sociotechnical experiments in the early stage, i.e. niche level. Preconditions and conditions of the experiment are analyzed, together with the presentations of observed phenomena, such as articulation of visions and development of networks. A critical review on the Icelandic experiment should provide us with useful lessons and policy implications for improving hydrogen energy activities not only in R&D but also especially in demonstration and deployment. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Design/methodology/approach: The framework of a multi-level perspective on transitions is used to describe the change process. At the lowest level of this perspective are the experimental niches acting as ""seeds of change"" represented by the case organisation, a municipal enterprise operating in the basic social and health care sector. The data consist of 16 thematic interviews with the key persons of the operating system, analysed with the principles of content analysis. Findings: The examination uncovers diverse pressures affecting niche level innovations and manifesting as clashes and controversies between old and new ways of thinking, but these clashes can also act as a platform for innovations when opened up, analysed and facilitated. Practical implications: Clashes that appear in societal transition processes and regime changes, both in the regimes and also on the organisational level, should not be seen solely as bottlenecks, because they can act as innovation potential when opened up and facilitated. This implies the need for not only new technological, service-related and organisational innovations in the public sector reform, but also innovative practices, ""second level innovations"". Originality/value: This paper contributes to the discussion on the ongoing change processes in the reform of the social and health care sector, emphasising emerging clashes not only as obstacles but opportunities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Finland; Health services; Innovation; Public sector reform; Social services",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Christensen, T., Citizens and consumers - a NPM dilemma (2005) Public Management Review, 7 (2), pp. 225-246; Afuah, A., (1998) Innovation Management: Strategies, Implementation and Profits, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY; Anttiroiko, A.-V., Haveri, A., Karhu, V., Ryynänen, A., Siitonen, P., (2003) Kuntien Toiminta, Johtaminen Ja Hallintasuhteet.

It compares three advanced Central Eastern European countries (Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic) with three laggard countries in South Eastern Europe (Albania, Macedonia, and Serbia and Montenegro). Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical framework is proposed based on three groups of factors influencing SME growth: innovative and entrepreneurial features of the firm, characteristics of the firm, and those related to the institutional/business environment. Subsequently this paper uses the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) conducted by the World Bank/EBRD in 2002 and 2005 to test a number of hypotheses regarding the determinants of SME growth. Findings: The two groups of countries have similarities and differences: both display similar trends with respect to the growth process; both are affected by entrepreneurship activities positively; but the institutional barriers affecting the two groups are somewhat different. It was also found that, despite the growing importance of SMEs in all transition economies, they still face many institutional barriers - which have prevented them from making a greater contribution. Research limitations/implications: The key limitations of the empirical investigation are the qualitative nature of survey data and the shortcomings associated with self-declaration of entrepreneurs. It is important for future research to complement this line of research with panel data. Originality/value: This cross-country study extends current understanding of the determinants of SME growth in various stages of transition economies based on a unique data set. It also provides some implications for policymakers as well as entrepreneurs/managers for improving the growth of SMEs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship; Growth; Innovation; Institutions; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Technological capability; Transition management",,,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Verdier, T., Property rights, corruption and the allocation of talent: A general equilibrium approach (1998) The Economics Journal, 108 (45), pp. 1381-1403; Acemoglu, D., Verdier, T., The choice between market failures and corruption (2000) American Economic Review, 90 (1), pp. 194-211; Acs, Z., Audretsch, D., (1990) Innovation and Small Firms, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Acs, Z., Audretsch, D., (2001) The emergency of the entrepreneurial society, , paper presented at the 2001 International Award for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research, Stockholm, 3 May; Aghion, P., Blundell, R., Bloom, N., Griffith, R., Howitt, P., Competition and innovation: An inverted u relationship (2005) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 120 (2), pp. 701-728; Aidis, R., Institutional barriers to small and medium-sized enterprise operations in transition countries (2005) Small Business Economics, 25 (4), pp. 305-317; Aidis, R., Estrin, S., (2006) Institutions, networks and entrepreneurship development in Russia: An exploration, , Institute for Study of Labour-IZA, Discussion Paper No. 2161, Bonn; Almus, M., What characterizes a fast-growing firm?

Design/methodology/approach: Adopting an interpretive methodological approach, in-depth semi-structured interviews were held with 27 owner-managers working in St Petersburg, Russia. Participants were asked about their intentions for their businesses, how they intended to grow and what, if anything, prevented or interfered with these intentions. Template analysis was used to develop owner-managers' perceptions and experiences of barriers to growth, and to facilitate theory building. Findings: Six ways in which perceived barriers influence the growth intentions and behaviours of small business owner-managers were identified. Barriers: stop owner-managers from intending to grow; undermine intentions; add to the ambivalence around growth intentions; provide incentives to grow; postpone intention realization; and slow down the process of realizing intentions to grow. Research limitations/implications: Because data were collected at one point in time, it was not possible to capture the dynamic nature of barriers or the intentions/behaviours they influenced. Future research could be strengthened through the use of longitudinal designs and process-based methods (e.g. diary studies). Practical implications: Educators and policy makers should help owner-managers understand the ways in which barriers can affect business growth and be overcome. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine how barriers influence growth intentions and behaviours, and to facilitate theory development on the topic. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business development; Economic change; Growth behaviours; Growth intentions; Perceived barriers; Qualitative research; Template analysis; Transition management",,,,,,,"Acs, Z., Audretsch, D.B., (1993) Small Firms and Entrepreneurship: An East-West Perspective, , Cambridge University Press; Aidis, R., (2003) By law and by custom: Factors affecting small and medium-sized enterprises during the transition in Lithuania, , published doctoral dissertation, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam; Aidis, R., Mickiewicz, T., (2004) Which entrepreneurs expect to expand their businesses?

N loading to the watersheds of the Lake Michigan Basin grew six-fold from 1880 to 2002, peaking in 1987. Human activities influenced N inputs as early as 1880, and the magnitude and timing of increase differed markedly across regions in accord with population growth, land use, and type of agriculture. The greatest increase occurred from 1950 to 1980, corresponding with rapidly accelerating use of artificial fertilizers, but increases in atmospheric deposition and shifting patterns in crop and livestock production also affected trends. Net anthropogenic N inputs have changed little since about 1980, showing a modest decline due to a leveling out of fertilizer use and greater export of animal feed and products. Using a model that predicts riverine N export from watershed N loadings and river discharge, we found that river TN fluxes from all tributaries increased approximately threefold from 1900 to 2000 but have stabilized or declined over the past two decades, consistent with national surveys that show near-constant or declining riverine TN concentrations. For the LMB, the past two decades has been a period of relative stasis in N inputs to its terrestrial systems and N export from watersheds. This retrospective analysis also points to the challenge of forecasting future trends in N budget terms, which can both increase and decline in response to policy and societal transitions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Catchment; Lake Michigan; N export; NANI; Nitrogen; Nutrient budget; Nutrient loading; River",,,,,,,,"Han, H.; Korea Environment Institute, Korea Adaptation Center for Climate Change, 290 Jinheungno, Eunpyeong-Gu, 122-706, Seoul, South Korea; email: hanhj@kei.re.kr",,,,,,,,01682563,,BIOGE,10.1007/s10533-011-9618-7,,"English","Biogeochemistry",Article in Press,Scopus

They aim for reflexivity regarding the limits of prognostic knowledge and actual control of complex processes of change. Adaptive management and transition management are two examples that evolved from the analysis of social-ecological and sociotechnical systems, respectively. Both feature strategies of collective experimentation and learning. In this paper, we ask how these two designs of reflexive governance consider politics. Based on a framework of different dimensions and levels of politics, we show that they are mainly concerned with problem solving by a focal process, but conflict and asymmetric power relations, as well as the embedding of processes within broader political contexts, are neglected. We suggest two routes for integrating politics into the design of reflexive governance: (1) recognize the politics of learning for sustainable development and develop safeguards against domination and capture by powerful actors, and (2) systematically consider the embedding of governance designs in political contexts and their ongoing dynamics for political fit. © 2011 by the author(s).","Adaptive management; Embedding in political context; Governance design; Politics; Reflexive governance; Societal learning; Transition management","adaptive management; governance approach; knowledge; learning; political relations; power relations; sustainable development",,,,,,"Allan, C., Stankey, G.H., (2009) Adaptive environmental management.

Such mechanisms define the key characteristics of a network of firms (i.e. the innovation niche), and the interaction among them guides the creation and development of a new technology. In this paper, we propose an agent-based model to investigate the dynamics characterising such interactions and the role that policy intervention can have in governing the niche development process. Specifically, we consider and assess the impact of two policy actions: (1) increasing actors' expectations towards the new technology by means of information spreading, and (2) providing subsidies aimed at stimulating technological switch. Our preliminary results confirm the importance of policy intervention and show the complementarity of the two policy measures considered. Hence, a mixed policy action could serve the purpose of a rapid and stable creation of an innovation-niche.",,,,,,,,"Geels, F.W., Schot, J., Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways (2007) Research Policy, 36, pp. 399-417; Kemp, R., Schot, J.W., Hoogma, R., Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: the approach of strategic niche management (1998) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 10, pp. 175-196; Kemp, R., Rip, A., Schot, J.W., Constructing transition paths through the management of niches (2001) Path Dependence and Creation, pp. 269-299. , By R.

Optimizing the efficacy of the contribution of research to such a food security agenda will probably also need new institutional mechanisms and career structures to facilitate new kinds of collaborations and ongoing, longer-term projects. In short, the multiple challenges of food security demand a different political economy of research for effective intervention by science. In making this argument, the paper summarizes the major findings of a recent report regarding the potential impact of so-called 'disruptive' low-carbon innovations in China. © 2011 The Author(s).","Agri-food system; ecology; food security; low carbon innovation",,,,,,,"Anderson, D., Costs and finance of abating carbon emissions in the energy sector (2006) Notes and Calculations Prepared for the Stern Review, , London: Imperial College; Beddington, J., Food, energy, water and the climate: A perfect storm of global events?

Specifically, it examines the impact of the shift on course design, and on the instructor's transitional learning process that occurred while moving a graduate course from distance face-to-face delivery format, to an on-line collaborative learning format using Wimba® software. The change process is documented through the use of self-study methodology (Samaras & Freese, 2006), and an exploratory framework for technological transitions of this type, is proposed. The framework focuses on four critical areas of transitional knowledge: Student Knowledge, Technical Knowledge, Experiential Knowledge and Reflective Knowledge.","Distance technology; Multi-user virtual environment; Self-study; Virtual teaching; Wimba®",,,,,,,"Ahern, T.C., Y El-Hindi, A.E., Improving the instructional congruency of a computer-mediated small-group discussion: A case study in design and delivery (2000) Journal of Research On Computing In Education, 32 (3), pp. 385-400; Argyris, C., (1990) Overcoming Organizational Defenses: Facilitating Organizational Learning, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Argyris, C., (1999) On Organizational Learning, , 2nd ed.)

Using in-depth interviews relating to the characteristics of the different stages leading up to and within their careers as school principals (childhood and academic studies; the struggle to achieve the position; and the period in their position as principal), the study reveals the characteristics and evolution of their managerial style. The research findings indicate that these are two highly motivated women who dared to swim against the tide from an early age and achieved their positions, albeit with the support of their families, but not without serious battles. As the first women principals in their communities they continue to develop, while coping with the norms of Arab patriarchal society, where they need to prove that, despite their gender and the associated expectations, they are effective leaders. This necessitated their initial adoption of an authoritarian administrative style, which they eventually adapt into a more empathetic style. The study contributes to the study of female management styles by showing the evolution of the two women's management styles within the context of their traditional society, thereby questioning previous studies that see women's management styles as a static phenomenon. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Arab women; Career transitions; Management; Managerial style; Women's leadership",,,,,,,"Abu-Baker, K., Career women' or 'working women'?Change versus stability for young Palestinian women in Israel.Part 2 (2003) The Journal of Israeli History, 21, pp. 85-89; Abu-Rabia-Queder, S., (2006) They Felt I Raped a Role Not Supposed to Be Mine: First Women Principals in a Bedouin Tribal Society, pp. 74-81. , Women principals in a multicultural society, ed.

Learning processes are necessary to support the efficient implementation of decentralised systems. These processes reveal the complex socio-technical and institutional factors to be considered when developing an enabling environment supporting decentralised water and wastewater servicing solutions. Critical to the technological transition towards established decentralised systems is the ability to create strategic and adaptive capacity to promote learning and dialogue. Learning processes require institutional mechanisms to ensure the lessons are incorporated into the formulation of policy and regulation, through constructive involvement of key government institutions. Engagement of stakeholders is essential to the enabling environment. Collaborative learning environments using systems analysis with communities (social learning) and adaptive management techniques are useful in refining and applying scientists' and managers' knowledge (knowledge management). © IWA Publishing 2011.","Adaptive governance; Community engagement; Decentralised systems; Social learning; Transition","Adaptive governance; Community engagement; Decentralised systems; Social learning; Transition; Distributed computer systems; Knowledge management; Management science; Marine pollution; Societies and institutions; Systems analysis; Wastewater; Water supply; Water supply systems; Computer supported cooperative work; fresh water; sea water; adaptive management; decentralization; environmental factor; freshwater environment; governance approach; marine environment; policy making; pollution control; stakeholder; state role; urban area; decentralised water system; decentralization; environmental health; health care policy; human; leadership; professional knowledge; review; risk management; scientist; social learning; urban area; waste water; water supply; Australia",,,,,,"Bicchieri, C., (2006) The Grammar of Society: The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Biggs, C., Ryan, C., Wiseman, J., Larsen, K., (2009) Distributed Water Systems: A Networked and Localised Approach for Sustainable Water Services, , Victorian Eco-Innovation Lab (VEIL), University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Blackstock, K., Kirk, E., Chang, Y.C., Davidson, G., (2006) Public Participation and Consultation in SEPA and Regulatory Regimes (R50063PUR), , Final Report: submitted to SEPA, March, Macaulay Research Consultancy Services in collaboration with Dept of Law, University of Dundee; Bosch, O.J.H., Ross, H., Beeton, R.J.S., Integrating science and management through collaborative learning and better information management (2003) Systems Research and Behavioural Science, 19, pp. 1-12; Brown, R.R., Farrelly, M., Keath, N., Summary report: Perceptions of institutional drivers and barriers to sustainable urban water management in Australia (2007) Survey Results of Urban Water Professionals Across Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth Monash University National Urban Water Governance Program, Melbourne, Australia; Brown, R.R., Farrelly, M.A., Delivering sustainable urban water management: A review of the hurdles we face (2009) Water Science and Technology, 59 (5), pp. 839-846; Cook, S., Tjandraatmadja, G., Ho, A., Sharma, A., Definition of Decentralised Systems in the South East Queensland Context (2009) Urban Water Security Research Alliance Technical Report No. 12; Crase, L., Dollery, B., Wallis, J., Community consultation in public policy: The case of theMurray-Darling Basin of Australia (2005) Australian Journal of Political Science, 40 (2), pp. 221-237; Daniels, S.E., Walker, G.B., Collaborative learning: Improving public deliberation in ecosystem-based management (1996) Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 16 (2), pp. 71-102; Doria, M., Factors influencing public perception of drinking water quality (2010) Water Policy, 12 (1), pp. 1-19; Douglas, M., (1986) Risk Acceptability According to the Social Sciences, , Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; Fazey, I., Fazey, J.A., Fazey, D.M.A., Learning more effectively from experience (2005) Ecology and Society, 10 (2), p. 4; Fischhoff, B., Slovic, P., Lichtenstein, S., Lay foibles and expert fables in judgements about risk (1978) The American Statistician, 36 (3), pp. 127-152; Folke, C., Hahn, T., Olsson, P., Norberg, J., Adaptive governance of social-ecological systems (2005) Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 30, pp. 441-473. , DOI 10.1146/annurev.energy.30.050504.144511; Frewer, L.J., Howard, C., Shepherd, R., Understanding public attitudes to technology (1998) Journal of Risk Research, 1, pp. 221-235; Geels, F.W., Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: A multi-level perspective and a case-study (2002) Research Policy, 31, pp. 1257-1274; Geels, F.W., Processes and patterns in transitions and system innovations: Refining the co-evolutionary multi-level perspective (2005) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 72 (6 SPEC.

This paper aims at featuring how users perceive and how they express themselves in relation to the deployment of a program known as Family Health Strategy (FHS) by a self-management health care provider. Through focal groups, the research reveals that users present a rather clear view on the meaning of strategy, including its remarkable rationalizing elements. In addition, they percept contradictions as well as deficiencies in the formulation and deployment process, and they keep a high level of autonomy in the choice for more adequate services, which are greatly influenced by the type of insertion that they exert in the bank institution that maintains the health care service provider. Users also perceive the predicament presented by self-management regarding the maintenance of a broad authorized free access network and the advance towards turning FHS into the structuring backbone of its assistance network.","Family health strategy; Self-management service provider; Supplemental health care; Technological transition in health",,,,,,,"Duas faces da mesma moeda: Microrregulação e modelos assistenciais na saúde suplementar (2005) Rio De Janeiro: ANS, p. 270. , CECÍLIO, L.C.O.

The institutional, technological and social bases of the Saskatchewan power regime have been disrupted by both exogenous pressures and endogenous problems, providing an opportunity for alternative energy options to be considered as possible power alternatives. As the province addresses the long-term socio-technical transition (STR) associated with a regime change in the power sector a number of alternative energy options have been identified. Using a transition management approach, this paper argues that the path taken will depend very much on whether these alternatives can be adopted as modifications of the existing STR - leaving the key actors, institutions and relationships essentially untouched - or whether they will necessitate a wholesale reconstruction of the regime itself. In this paper we analyze how, over time, the socio-technical configurations of the energy system became very durable as existing technologies become embedded in regulatory frameworks, infrastructure, users practices and expert communities. We then consider the potential of several alternative technological trajectories and the likelihood of one of these socio technical regimes emerging in Saskatchewan. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Policy change; Saskatchewan power; Transition management","Alternative energy; Canadian prairie; Energy systems; Key Actors; Nuclear power; Policy changes; Power alternatives; Power sector; Regulatory frameworks; Saskatchewan; Saskatchewan power; Socio-technical regimes; Sociotechnical; Transition management; Nuclear energy; alternative energy; energy policy; nuclear power; Canada; Saskatchewan",,,,,,"Appleton, B., (1994) Navigating NAFTA: A concise user's guide to the North American Free Trade Agreement, , Carswell Legal Publications; Avelino, F., Rotmans, J., Power in transition an interdisciplinary framework to study power in relation to structural change (2009) European Journal of Social Theory, 12 (4), pp. 543-569; Berkhout, F., Smith, A., Stirling, A., Understanding system innovations: a critical literature review and a conceptual synthesis (2004) System Innovation and the Transition to Sustainability: Theory, Evidence and Policy, pp. 48-75. , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, Glos, B.

A methodological framework for participatory backcasting is presented, after which a conceptual framework is developed to describe and evaluate the impact of backcasting experiments. Three cases are analysed: (1) Novel Protein Foods and meat alternatives; (2) Sustainable Household Nutrition; and (3) Multiple Sustainable Land-use in rural areas. The cases show that participatory backcasting can lead to substantial follow-up and spin-off, but that is not always the case. Substantial follow-up and spin-off after five to ten years is predominantly found at the level of niches, and can be seen as potential seeds for future system innovations. The emergence of follow-up and spin-off comes along with the diffusion of the visions generated in the backcasting experiment. The visions provide orientation (where to go) and guidance (what to do). Visions also show both stability and flexibility. Factors that influence the extent of impact and spin-off of backcasting are identified, with a focus on stakeholders, learning and visions. Finally, relevance for system innovation theory, governance and policy as well as research recommendations are briefly discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Future vision; Learning; Participatory backcasting; Socio-technical transitions; Stakeholders; Sustainability foresight; System innovation","Backcasting; Future vision; Learning; Sociotechnical; Stakeholders; Sustainability foresight; System innovation; Experiments; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Innovation; innovation; learning; participatory approach; stakeholder; sustainability; Netherlands",,,,,,"Elzen, B., Geels, F.W., Green, K., (2004) System innovation and the transition to sustainability, , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham UK/Northampton MA; Rotmans, J., Kemp, R., van Asselt, M., More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy (2001) Foresight, 3, pp. 15-31; Quist, J., (2007) Backcasting for a sustainable future: the impact after ten years, , Eburon, Delft NL; Loorbach, D., (2007) Transition Management: a New Mode of Governance for Sustainable Development, , International Books, Utrecht NL; (2008) System Innovation for Sustainability 1: Perspectives on Radical Changes to Sustainable Consumption and Production, , Greenleaf Publishers, Sheffield UK, A.

Yet, the methods and processes used to understand and guide those dynamics remain deficient in their treatment of that coupling. Lack of bi-directional coupling of human system dynamics with the dynamics of the larger environment within which humanity operates stymies the ability of researchers and policymakers to anticipate and limit the unintended consequences of technological change and help guide associated societal transitions.

In different ways and degrees, these implicate many contrasting perspectives, including innovation studies, evolutionary economics and transitions research. The paper therefore attends equally to the implications of plurality among disciplines as observing subjects and varieties of sociotechnical configurations as observed objects. Inspired by recent literatures in these fields, the argument focuses in turn on: contending social normativities concerning alternative directions for innovation; divergent disciplinary understandings of societal transitions; and disparate conceptualisations of sociotechnical diversity itself. In each area, the paper identifies some persistent forms of 'misplaced concreteness'. Recommendations are made as to how the implications of diversity might be addressed in more rigorous and reflective ways. In conclusion, it is shown how rigour and reflexivity themselves depend on plural analytical communities paying greater regard to diversity and striking their own balance between pluralism and concreteness. This highlights a series of specific, but hitherto unresolved, research questions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The emphasis is on the intertwined role of organizational solutions and their institutional settings. This is not to say that technological solutions to environmental problems should be dismissed. However, it is argued that 'environmental innovation' is often of organizational nature, deeply embedded in institutions that adapt very slowly, making 'societal transitions' particularly challenging. The New Institutional Economics provides some key concepts to explore these dimensions and their interactions, thus shedding light on alternative solutions and the conditions of their implementation.

Thus, these two characteristics create in a mutually reinforcing way less favorable circumstances for the introduction of new clean energy technologies as compared to the social optimum, even if welfare losses from emissions are internalized.

In so doing, however, backcasting may run the risk of obscuring significant differences in current lived experience, negating alternative problem framings and normatively derived views of what constitutes sustainability. This paper reports an innovative UK attempt to develop an inclusive 'bottom-up' community foresight process for urban sustainability research. Unlike most backcasting studies, the methodology was initially grounded in an exploration of the community participants' current lived experience and understandings of sustainability. Given the particular purpose of the study the primary outcome from the work was structured around the articulation of a 'community-led' agenda for urban sustainability research, rather than an explicit normative vision and transition pathway. However, the methodology could easily be adapted for use in other contexts, and showed potential to contribute to the formation of local 'transition arenas': facilitating network formation and building capacity for local sustainability initiatives and experiments. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Citizens' science; Community foresight; Transition management; Up-stream engagement; Urban sustainability","Citizens' science; Community foresight; Transition management; Up-stream engagement; Urban sustainability; Electric grounding; Engineering research; Sustainable development; bottom-up approach; capacity building; forecasting method; local participation; planning process; social change; sustainability; urban society",,,,,,"Kemp, R., Loorbach, D., Transition Management: A Reflexive Governance Approach (2006) Reflexive Governance for Sustainable Development, pp. 103-130. , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, Glos, J.-P.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on an empirical survey of 3,000 large Canadian and US firms, this study investigates the role of PO in various aspects of ES implementation. Exploratory factor analysis is conducted using SPSS software to identify indicators and factors of measuring PO and various aspects of ES implementation. Furthermore, the LISREL software was used to perform the path analysis to identify the role of PO. Findings - The results of the analysis strongly suggest that the PO levels at three phases of ES implementation are independent and, hence, require separate measurement. In addition, two research models are employed to examine 14 hypotheses associated with the role of PO in ES implementation. The findings indicate that process-oriented organizations in our sample are more successful in ES implementation and have faced fewer challenges in the transition process. Practical implications - This study unveils the role of PO in successful ES implementation. The champions of transition pay special attention to PO throughout the ES implementation. The findings reveal that under certain conditions PO can hinder or support the ES implementation in organizations. Originality/value - This is the first study that measures PO at three phases of ES implementation. Moreover, two research models are employed to study the research topic, namely: preliminary model, and expanded model.

The sustainable development discourse has always had a strong technological component and the literature boasts an enormous amount of debate on which technologies should be developed and employed and how this can most efficiently be done. The mainstream discourse in sustainable development argues for an eco-efficiency approach in which a technology push strategy boosts efficiency levels by a factor 10 and more in industrialised and developing countries. A minority argues for a socio-cultural lifestyle switch, relying on new values, quality of life, sufficiency and redistribution strategies, with calls for appropriate and soft technologies. It is remarkable, however, that the articles, books and policy debates on sustainability seldom explicitly draw in a discussion of the nature of technology, how technology influences and is influenced by society, and what this implies for sustainable development. The mainstream interprets technology as neutral and instrumental: technology is no more than an instrument to reach a goal; it cannot be judged on its intrinsic characteristics, only on its use. The alternative view often builds on an autonomous and substantive interpretation of technology: technology is an autonomous, almost uncontrollable power that fundamentally reshapes our culture. A more balanced approach seems to be growing in the research on socio-technical sustainability transitions where the focus shifts to the co-evolution of technology and society, and to the networks, seamless webs and complex multi-actor processes that may carry a sustainability transition forward. This approach builds on insights from recent traditions in the philosophy and sociology of technology, in particular the social construction of technology (SCOT) and actor-network theory (ANT). While this provides for a better understanding of the nature and potential role of technology in sustainability policies, it remains to be seen whether it will actually influence the choice between technologies. This article investigates the different conceptualisations of technology in the sustainability debate. It first distinguishes between different approaches of sustainability and how these are related to differing views on technology. It then moves on to how the socio-technical transitions research incorporates insights from contemporary philosophy and sociology of technology. It reflects on the potential of transitions research to give guidance in technology choices, suggesting that the transition approach might be strengthened by drawing in insights from critical theory of technology and by taking a more political stance in defining sustainable development. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Philosophy of technology; Socio-technical transitions research; Sustainable development; Sustainable technology; Transition governance",,,,,,,"Achterhuis, H., (1995) Natuur Tussen Mythe En Techniek, , Baarn: Ambo; Achterhuis, H., American philosophy of technology (2001) The empirical turn, , Bloomington: Indiana University Press; Banuri, T., Weyant, J., Akuma, G., Najam, A., Pinguelli, R.L., Rayner, S., Sachs, W., Yohe, G., Setting the stage: Climate change and sustainable development (2001) Climate Change 2001: Mitigation, Contribution of Working III to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , B.

The institutional, technological and social bases of the Saskatchewan power regime have been disrupted by both exogenous pressures and endogenous problems, providing an opportunity for alternative energy options to be considered as possible power alternatives. As the province addresses the long-term socio-technical transition (STR) associated with a regime change in the power sector a number of alternative energy options have been identified. Using a transition management approach, this paper argues that the path taken will depend very much on whether these alternatives can be adopted as modifications of the existing STR - leaving the key actors, institutions and relationships essentially untouched - or whether they will necessitate a wholesale reconstruction of the regime itself. In this paper we analyze how, over time, the socio-technical configurations of the energy system became very durable as existing technologies become embedded in regulatory frameworks, infrastructure, users practices and expert communities. We then consider the potential of several alternative technological trajectories and the likelihood of one of these socio technical regimes emerging in Saskatchewan. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It is based on visions of sustainable mobility, the use of strategic experiments and special programmes for system innovation, to complement transport policies such as road pricing, emission standards and so on. The article does three things: it describes the model of transition management as a model for transformation and where it comes from, it offers recommendations for mobility policy derived from transition thinking, and it discusses the uptake of transition thinking in policy and practice. The conclusion is that transition management helps various actors to be more engaged with long-term change, but that a process of re-institutionalisation is needed to make serious progress to systems of mobility which combine user benefits with societal benefits.","Sustainable mobility; Transition management",,,,,,,"Avelino, F., Kemp, R., Newspeak or Paradigm Shift?

Standard methods of quantification are used to assess species diversity, sampling sufficiency and taxa presence. The assessment of dendrological features provides additional evidence for growth trends and cutting cycles analogous with cyclical woodland management, as well as environmental and growing conditions. Analysis of archaeological charcoal from four medieval bloomery furnace sites in Bilsdale, and from the site of the hammersmithy and blast furnace at the early modern iron works at Rievaulx, provide comparable data-sets which indicate a change in cutting practise and dominant species selection for industrial fuelwood occurred between the 12th- and mid-16th centuries AD. Results show that dominant species presence changed from an admixture of predominantly birch (Betula sp.) and hazel (Corylus avellana) sourced from small calibre branchwood and stemwood used in the medieval bloomery furnaces, to a dominant oak (Quercus sp.) presence from standard sources used at the Rievaulx iron works by the mid-16th century. Whilst it is uncertain whether this change in dominant species composition and the source of industrial fuelwood is related to changes in local availability, or the result of the technological transition to blast furnace processing which occurred at this time, estate records reveal a woodland management campaign was instigated to supply and maintain fuelwood supplies to the iron works at Rievaulx which coincides with the introduction of Tudor arboricultural legislation in the 1540s. © Association for Environmental Archaeology 2011 Published by Maney.","Archaeological charcoal; Iron-smelting; Medieval early modern; Species selection; Woodland management",,,,,,,"Ashcroft, M.Y., Hill, A.M., (1980) Bilsdale Surveys 1637-1851, , Northallerton: North Yorkshire County Record Office; Asouti, E., Austin, P., Reconstructing woodland vegetation and its exploitation by past societies, based on the analysis and interpretation of archaeological wood charcoal macro-remains (2005) Environmental Archaeology, 10, pp. 1-18; Atkinson, J.C., Cartularium Abbathiæ de Rievalle ordinis Cisterciensis (1889) Publications of the Surtees Society, 83. , Durham: Andrews and Co./London: Whittaker and Co./Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons; Bernard, V., Renaudin, S., Margueire, D., Evidence of trimmed oaks (Quercus sp.) in north western France during the early middle ages (9th-11th centuries AD) (2006) BAR International Series, 1483, pp. 103-108. , Dufraisse, A.

We investigate the effects of this process on Chinese energy consumption patterns. Three energy-consuming sectors intricately associated with urbanization are identified and analyzed: residential households, transportation, and the building materials industry. Urbanization has profoundly affected each; moreover, the latter two are high energy consumption and potentially high carbon producing. We estimate energy consumption attributable to each sector to quantitatively evaluate their impacts on societal transition. Transportation and the production of building materials are identified as the most significant linkages from urbanization to energy consumption. Strikingly, despite the large increase in the proportion of the population that is urban, the share of urban energy consumption, as estimated here, in total energy consumption has remained stable. This suggests that economic growth, in the form of the production of goods for export and domestic consumption, is the most important driver of energy demand in China. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","China; Circular economy; Energy consumption; Low carbon economy; Urbanization",,,,,,,,"Zhu, B.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; email: bingzhu@tsinghua.edu.cn",,,,,,,,01990039,,,10.1007/s11111-011-0133-5,,"English","Population and Environment",Article in Press,Scopus

Protein supply is crucial, nutritionally and environmentally. Livestock products have disproportionate impacts on biodiversity loss, freshwater depletion, climate change and other issues. Use of natural resources must be reduced by applying the biorefinery principle and closing cycles.

Drawing on the literature on societal and institutional embedding of planning, evolution of planning systems and the theory of transition, we present the case study of the changing societal context and planning legislation in the Republic of Serbia by comparing the contents, processes, and tools prescribed by the laws enacted in 1985-before the fall of communism-and in 1995 and 2003-in the post-communist era. We find that the societal context and the level of political centralization in particular, are strong determinants of spatial planning legislation and system in Serbia. Other factors, such as the economic system and circumstances, professional culture and institutional maturity also significantly influence planning laws and their implementation. Planning systems and laws, indeed, mimic the societal dynamics with tendencies in path-dependency and discontinuity as well as innovation and re-invention that evade easy qualifications. The case study exposes the complex nature and meaning of societal transition vis-à-vis evolutionary and transformational views of planning. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",,"communism; democratization; economic system; implementation process; innovation; planning legislation; planning system; spatial planning; Serbia",,,,,,"Alden, J., Planning at a national scale: A new planning framework for the UK (2001) The Changing Landscape of Planning, pp. 55-82. , in: L.

In this transition pattern, novelties are initially adopted as 'modular innovation' into existing systems and subsequently reconfigure the basic architecture through new combinations of old and new elements. Incumbent actors survive these transitions through interactions with suppliers of knowledge and innovations. Using Pavitt's innovation typology, we selected a case study from his supplier-dominated category: greenhouse farming. The article makes a techno-economic analysis of the overall transition pattern in Dutch greenhouse horticulture (1930-1980) and a socio-institutional analysis of the knowledge flows and networks. 'Innovation cascades' are identified as a particularly important mechanism in reconfiguration transitions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Greenhouse horticulture; Knowledge flows; Reconfiguration; Sectoral innovation system; Technological transition","agricultural technology; greenhouse gas; horticulture; innovation; knowledge; technology adoption",,,,,,"Anderson, P., Tushman, M., Technological discontinuities and dominant designs: A cyclical model of technological change (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (4), pp. 604-633; Barendse, J., (1949) 25 Years of Horticultural Teaching, Extension and Research in the Southern Dutch Greenhouse Area, 1924-1949, , 25 Jaar Tuinbouwonderwijs, -voorlichting, -onderzoek In Het Zuid-Hollands Glasdistrict 1924-1949.

Further, we propose a taxonomy of various niche development statuses. The proposed empirical methodology is subsequently tested on a specific case study where we assess the development status of the emerging bio-refinery niche situated in the province of Foggia (Apulia Region, Italy).

This insightful and practical paper aims to describe a holistic, integrated approach organizations can use to build the necessary leadership capacity required to ensure changes are both successful and sustainable over time. Design/methodology/approach: Five decades of using change management as the standard approach to helping organizations change have left a legacy of many more failures than successes. Integrating the essential components of strategy, change, transition and communication, the paper outlines specific actions leaders at all levels must undertake to lead change successfully throughout their organization. Insights are gained from decades of work with hundreds of leaders in changing organizations around the world. Findings: This integrated approach ensures the desired results are achieved within the given budgets and timelines, people come through the changes no worse off and the organization as a whole fulfills its strategic mandate. That is accomplished through the work of competent leadership continually dedicating time and effort at addressing the fourth challenge their organization faces - changing the way they change. Originality/value: The most important competency every organization requires today is the ability to change and evolve to keep pace with the fluid, dynamic global environment. Old habits are no longer up to the task. This integrated approach to leading change builds the necessary leadership skills to help organizations learn how to sustain change successfully. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication; Corporate strategy; Leadership; Organizational change; Sustainable development; Transition management",,,,,,,,"Edgelow, C.; Sundance Consulting Inc, Edmonton, Canada; email: chris@sundance.ca",,,,,,,,00197858,,,10.1108/00197851111098126,,"English","Industrial and Commercial Training",Article,Scopus

The central idea is that any transition path can be considered a concatenation of patterns. Although theorising on transitions has advanced greatly, a coherent and integral approach was still lacking. Therefore, the current conceptual language of transitions is reframed and expanded from a complexity view on societal systems. The resulting theoretical framework straightforwardly leads to the identification of the patterns presented. The Dutch healthcare system is used to demonstrate how this multi-pattern approach could be used to describe transitions and make storylines. Furthermore a typology of transition paths derived from this approach is presented as another way in which these patterns may be used. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Complexity; Societal systems; Storylines; Transition paths; Transition patterns","Complexity; Societal systems; Storylines; Transition paths; Transition patterns; complexity; social change; typology",,,,,,"Timmermans, J., de Haan, J., Squazzoni, F., Computational and mathematical approaches to societal transitions (2008) Computational & Mathematical Organization Theory, 14 (4), pp. 391-414; Levinthal, D.A., The slow pace of rapid technological change: gradualism and punctuation in technological change (1998) Industrial and Corporate Change, 7 (2), p. 32; Rogers, E.M., (2003) Diffusion of Innovations, p. 512. , Free Press, New York; Geels, F., Technological transitions and system innovations (2005) A Co-Evolutionary and Socio-Technical Analysis, p. 279. , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, UK; Northampton, MA, USA; Kemp, R., Schot, J., Hoogma, R., Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: the approach of strategic niche management (1998) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 10 (2), pp. 175-195; Rotmans, J., Methods for IA: the challenges and opportunities ahead (1998) Environmental Modeling & Assessment, 3 (3), pp. 155-179; Rip, A., Kemp, R., Technological change (1998) Human Choice and Climate Change, pp. 327-399. , Battelle Press, Columbus, Ohio, S.

In the Czech Republic, one of the post-communist countries undergoing societal transition, there was a significant decrease in smoking prevalence during 1985-1997, followed by certain stagnation in prevalence of smokers. The most serious problem is the smoking among young population and socially disadvantaged groups. This paper examines social inequalities in smoking in the Czech population using multilevel approach. Data were analysed by multilevel modelling using smoking in the past, current smoking and current moderate/heavy smoking as outcomes of interest. Men were significantly more likely to be smokers than women. Further, the analysis confirmed that current smoking is the most common among young people. Education was strongly inversely related to all smoking outcomes. Smoking was also significantly more reported by divorced and unemployed individuals. While the association between small-area characteristics and smoking was limited, smoking was more common in the areas with higher unemployment and higher proportion of non-Czech nationals. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Czech Republic; Inequalities; Multilevel analysis; Smoking","gender; public health; smoking; socioeconomic status; young population; adult; article; controlled study; Czech Republic; divorce; education; female; health care access; human; male; priority journal; risk assessment; sex difference; smoking; social behavior; socioeconomics; transition temperature; unemployment; Czech Republic",,,,,,"Bartley, M., Fitzpatrick, R., Firth, D., Marmot, M., Social distribution of cardiovascular disease risk factors: change among men in England 1984-1993 (2000) J.

Unit-level climate attitudes, perceived work stress, and training completion were measured in a field-setting over a 6-year period. Trends and moderating influences of climate consensus were estimated from data collected from several sources (employees, managers, supervisors, and technical coordinators) using multiple methods (archival records, interviews, and surveys). As expected, climate consensus weakened over time, and interacted with climate for innovation to predict training completion with varying effects that depended upon implementation period and training type (Internet versus general technology). More training completion occurred when climate consensus was strong prior to implementation and weak during and after implementation indicating that the merits of strong and positive climate attitudes may be specific to early implementation stages. Less attitudinal agreement may be more beneficial to units once implementation is underway. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The role assigned to education in promoting sustainability by international documents has yet to be applied to national strategies in many countries. This paper aims to promote a strategic approach and to identify techniques for analysis to be used in development of quality education programs, tailored to specific needs in protected areas and to sustainability goals in a particular social context. Design/methodology/approach: Using an adult education approach and social science methodology, a proposal for a research framework is offered, seeking a better understanding of the role of education in improving sustainable protected area governance. Within the framework of sustainable development and lifelong learning concepts, the existing gap in the field is discussed and a brief review of the issues present in Serbia as a country in transition is given. Practical implications: This approach may be modified to specific contexts and goals, and applied with this purpose to other similar social environments, especially in countries in transition within the region. It may lead to creating more adequate education programs and increased capacities for managing protected areas. Originality/value: The paper moves away from a project-driven, ad hoc and rather scholarly to an integral approach to capacities for sustainable protected area governance, including an institutional, organizational and individual level and a lifelong learning perspective. It also promotes a specific, contextual and participatory definition of sustainability, rather than seeking for a universal one. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Education; Governance; Lifelong learning; Transition management",,,,,,,"Bridgewater, P., Biosphere reserves: A network for conservation and sustainability (2002) Parks, 12 (3), pp. 15-20; Cvijanovic, D., Mihailovic, B., Simonovic, Z., (2008) Transition in Serbia: Effects and Limitations, , Institute of Agricultural Economics, Belgrade; (2008) Guidelines for Applying Protected Area Management Categories, , Dudley, N.

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the legitimacy needs of organizations evolving in transition environments and trying to access a different environmental layer, we developed a signalling theory of legitimacy. Findings: When trying to move from one layer of the environment to another one, organizations will use different types of legitimacy signals in order to address the liabilities they face. Research limitations/implications: The research examines organizations facing both drastic environmental changes and evolving in a global industry. Future research can separately study the impact of each factor; and also investigate additional types of liabilities. Practical implications: The study can help organizations from transition and emerging economies identify and employ signals that can enhance their organizational legitimacy, which may affect their performance. Additionally, public policy implications are developed in order to stimulate local businesses. Originality/value: The multidimensionality of a signalling theory of legitimacy - functional and relational - increases our understanding of organizations facing liabilities, such as firms evolving in transition environments and trying to access the global marketplace. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Globalization; Transition management",,,,,,,"Aldrich, H.E., Fiol, C.M., Fools rush in?

Specifically, we present a methodological conceptualization of innovation-niches and propose a preliminary protocol, based on a Social Network Analysis (SNA), aiming to capture and measure the internal status of niches. The suggested protocol provides a toolkit with insights on three SN concepts which can be used to study and measure the evolution process of technological niches. This allowed us to suggest a set of possible policy actions, which derives directly from the conceptualisation of innovation-niches propose in this paper.

It illustrates Patten's role in the cross-fertilization between early institutionalists and the German Historicists. Patten's views on the societal transition to abundance, the method of social inquiry, and the role of social scientists are re-examined in light of the current exigencies of a climate-constrained, post-industrial economy. The policy implications that emerge from Patten's rejection of the presumption of scarcity are examined in a contemporary context. The article suggests that the historical and evolutionary approach that Patten fostered among institutionalists is essential to the identification and implementation of the socio-economic reform requisite of an age of abundance. © 2010, Journal of Economic Issues/Association for Evolutionary Economics.","abundance; consumption habits; institutionalist method; sustainability; work time",,,,,,,"Dewey, J., (1935) Liberalism and Social Action, , New York: G.

A method was developed for constructing visions of the transport system over the next 50 years. The method was then put into practice, and an experimental vision for the year 2100 was created. As a foundation for this preliminary study, a literature survey was carried out to scan both the relevant future analysis methods and the publications of longterm futures studies, particularly those dealing with transportation. The main future analysis methods and tools that were selected and integrated into the vision building method, and further used while bringing the pilot vision to life, were transition management, PESTE analysis and a futures table. The three-step vision building method consists of the following phases: (1) environmental scanning, (2) building up the futures table and the visions, and (3) description of the visions. As an exercise, a small-scale vision was developed to describe the Finnish transport system in 2100, where a few metropolitan areas define the competitiveness of the entire nation. The experiment proved the three-step method successful. As a result from the preliminary study, a more extensive vision building project using the developed method can be recommended.

As a result, group mobility scenarios have emerged, especially over VANs on public transport networks (e.g., buses, trains, aircraft, and so on). Therefore, when a group of users roam as a single unit, the NGMN must be equipped with efficient route optimization and group mobility management support. In light of this, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined the NEtwork MObility (NEMO) basic support protocol for location transition management for a group of members moving between two networks. Nevertheless, IETF's group mobility management solution is limited to homogeneous networks. Therefore, this paper proposes the integration of NEMO support for NGMN architectures for enabling group mobility management among multiple heterogeneous networks. Further, according to the evaluation and results, it is also capable of successfully handling handoff and mobility management for complex nested mobility scenarios. ©2010 IEEE.","IMS; MIP-NEMO; Mobile IP; NEMO; Network mobility; SIP; SIP-NEMO; UMTS; WiMAX","IMS; MIP-NEMO; Mobile IP; NEMO; Network mobility; SIP; Sip-nemo; UMTS; Heterogeneous networks; Internet protocols; Locomotives; Management; Mobile devices; Railroad cars; Trucks; Wimax; Wireless networks; Network management",,,,,,"Lach, H.Y., Janneteau, C., Petrescu, A., Network mobility in beyond-3G systems (2003) IEEE Communications Magazine, 41 (7), pp. 52-57. , Jul; Devarapalli, V., (2005) Network Mobility Basic Support Protocol, , IETF RFC 3963, Jan; Perera, E., Sivaraman, V., Seneviratne, A., A Survey on Network Mobility Support (2004) Mobile Computing and Communications Review, 8; Huang, C.M., Lee, C.H., Zheng, J.R., A novel SIP based route optimization for network mobility (2006) IEEE Journal in Selected Areas in Communications, 24 (9), pp. 1682-1691. , Sept; Munasinghe, K.S., Jamalipour, A., NEtwork MObility (NEMO) support in Interworking Heterogeneous Mobile Networks Proceedings of the IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC2010) Sydney, Australia, March, 2010; Huang, C.M., Lee, C.H., Tseng, P.H., Multihomed SIP-based Network Mobility Using IEEE 802.21 Media Independet Handover IEEE Communications Conference, Dresden, Germany, Jun. 2009; Camarillo, G., Roach, A., (2007) Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)-List Services, , draft-ietf-sipping-uri-services-07, Nov; Chiang, W.K., Ren, A.N., Chung, Y.C., Integrating SIP-based Network Mobility into IP Multimedia Subsystem Proceedings of the IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking, Budapest, Hungry, Apr. 2009; Varma, V.K., Mobility management in integrated UMTS/WLAN networks Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, Anchorage, Alaska, May 2003; Munasinghe, K.S., Jamalipour, A., A Unified Mobility and Session Management Platform for Next Generation Mobile Networks Proceedings of the IEEE Globecom, Washington DC, Nov. 2007; (2005) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), , 3GPP, 3GPP TS 23.228 Version 6.10.0 Release 6; (2000) Combined GSM and Mobile IP Mobility Handling in UMTS IP CN, , 3GPP, 3GPP TR 23.923 v 3.0.0; Perkins, C., (2002) IP Mobility Support for IPv4, , IETF RFC 3344; Enrique, A.H., (2005) SIP-IMS Model for OPNET Modeler, , OPNET University Program Contributed Models","Munasinghe, K.

Organizations need to rethink their communication, marketing and sale channels and how their employees and customers interact together internally and externally. Following this new trend, they also need to adopt their IT infrastructure and enhance their online presence and services in order to stay competitive in their businesses. Through this technological transition to Web 2.0 paradigm new security and privacy issues arise which should be taken into consideration to protect the whole Rich Internet Application (RIA) components. Web 2.0 has also introduced new possibilities for a better human computer interaction via rich internet applications such as Mashups that provide a user-driven micro-integration of web-accessible data. At the moment Mashups are mainly used for less important tasks such as customized queries and map-based visualizations; however they have the potential to be used for more fundamental, complex and sophisticated tasks in combination with business processes. In this paper, the security and privacy aspects of Mashup Architecture and some existing challenges will be discussed in more details. © 2010 IEEE.","Business intelligence; Business process; Mashup; Privacy; Security; SOA; Web 2.0","Business intelligence; Business Process; Mash-up; Privacy; Security; SOA; Web 2.0; Human computer interaction; Internet; Management science; Network architecture; Visualization; World Wide Web",,,,,,"Douglis, F., Feldmann, A., Krishnamurthy, B., Mogul, J., Rate of change and other metrics: A live study of the World Wide Web USENIX Symp. on Internet Technologies and Systems, 1997; Engelbart, C.D., (1995) Boosting Our Collective IQ: Selected Readings, , BLT Press, ISBN: 1-895936-01-2; O'Reilly, T., (2005) What Is Web 2.0: Design Patterns and Business Models for the next Generation of Software, , http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/ whatis-web-20.html, September; O'Reilly, T., (2006) Levels of the Game: The Hierarchy of Web 2.0 Applications, , http://radar.oreilly.com/2006/07/levels-of-the-game-the-hierarc.html, July; Schmelzer, R., Rich Internet Applications: Market Trends and Approaches (2006) ZapThink Foundation Report, , July; Really Simple Syndication, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS, last visited May 2009; Representational State Transfer, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer, last visited May 2009; Top 10 Strategic Technologies for 2009 (2008) Gartner Symposium/ITxpo, , http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=777212, October; Gartner Five Business Intelligence Predictions for 2009 (2009) Gartner Business Intelligence Summit 2009, , http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=856714, January; http://www.sunlightlabs.com/, last visited May 2009Apps for America 2 Contest, , http://www.sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica2/, last visited June 2010; http://www.data.gov/, Data.gov, last visited May 2009http://blogs.jackbe.com/2008/03/mashup-security-101.html, website, last visited May 2010Anjomshoaa, A., (2009) Integration of Personal Servicres into Global Business, , PhD thesis, Vienna University of Technology; Ogrinz, M., (2009) Mashup Patterns, Design and Examples for the Modern Enterprise, p. 23. , Addison-Wesley, ISBN: 978-0-321-57947-8; Andjomshoaa, A., Bader, G., Tjoa, A.M., Exploiting Mashup Architecture in Business Use Cases (2009) NBIS Conference 2009; http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/25/facebook-privacy-controls-2/, article, last visited June 2010http://www.seekda.com, website, last visited April 2010Radhamani, G., Rao, G.S.V.R.K., (2007) Web Services Security and E-Business, , ISBN: 978-1599041681; Creative Commons Organization Austria, , www.creativecommons.at, last visited June 2010; (2009) Cloud Computing Risk Assessment, , European Network and.

A main driver of this trend has been the recent approval of ambitious local regulations aimed at saving water and using decentralised, alternative resources in a context of growing scarcity. Users must assume new responsibilities in water management and new capacities need to be developed at the very micro level to attain a successful implementation of these regulations. A survey of 120 greywater users and in-depth interviews with the main actors of the water sector was conducted in the town of Sant Cugat del Valls, in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. The municipality's six years experience on greywater use provided an exceptional opportunity to assess community perceptions during the socio-technical transition process. Sant Cugat was the first municipality in Spain that enforced the installation of such systems in new buildings. Results show that the perception of health risks, operation regimes, perceived costs and environmental awareness are, in different degrees, significant determinants of public acceptance. The main institutional, technical, and economic challenges that need to be addressed during the ongoing socio-technical transition process are also explored. Improving the level of knowledge of these systems among users would reduce the risk of social refusal of the new technology. Public authorities and implementers need to stimulate social learning processes with specific actions and build trust among residents in the new governance network if decentralised and alternative water supply systems are to find a place in the everyday life of urban populations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes the form of a review. Findings: Although the UK medical profession enjoyed a remarkably stable regulatory structure for most of the first 150 years of its existence, it has undergone a striking transformation in the last decade. Its regulatory form has mutated from one of state-sanctioned collegial self-regulation to one of state-directed bureaucratic regulation. The erosion of medical self-regulation can be attributed to: the pressures of market liberalisation and new public management reforms; changing ideologies and public attitudes towards expertise and risk; and high profile public failures involving doctors. The ""new"" UK medical regulation converts the General Medical Council into a modern regulator charged with implementing policy, and alters the mechanisms for controlling and directing the conduct and performance of doctors. It establishes a new set of relationships between the medical profession and the state (including its agencies), the public, and patients. Originality/value: This paper adds to the literature by identifying the main features of the reforms affecting the medical profession and offering an analysis of why they have taken place. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Doctors; Medical sciences; Public administration; Regulation; Transition management","article; government regulation; health care delivery; health care policy; human; legal aspect; physician; United Kingdom; Delivery of Health Care; Government Regulation; Great Britain; Health Care Reform; Humans; Physicians",,,,,,"Ackroyd, S., Organization contra organizations: Professions and organizational change in the United Kingdom (1996) Organization Studies, 17, pp. 599-621; Allsop, J., Mulcahy, L., (1996) Regulating Medical Work: Formal and Informal Controls, , Open University, Buckingham; Arluke, A., Social control rituals in medicine: The case of the death rounds (1977) Health Care and Health Knowledge, , Dingwall, R., Heath, C., Reid, M., Stacey, M.

Design/methodology/approach: This study takes a conceptual stance, using the careers and diffusion of innovation literature to identify the major variables. Findings: Two innovations and two major refinements in career management tactics suggested by contemporary career concepts are identified, personal criteria for transition success are described, and likely barriers to accepting these tactical innovations are hypothesized. Other factors likely to affect transition success are also revealed by analyzing a conceptual model of interorganizational transition success. Originality/value: The paper introduces the idea that the use of new career management tactics might be related to interorganizational transition success or the lack of it. It proposes one method of developing quantitative data about how personal career management may be changing, as well as providing normative data about perceptions of successful and unsuccessful interorganizational transitions.

Design/methodology/approach: The literature search encompassed articles on the transition of periodicals between print and electronic status. Findings: Libraries will soon have to decide, based on budget, what is affordable in terms of periodicals. Vendors are integral to this process and libraries need to negotiate skillfully with them in order to keep costs in line. Electronic resources will serve researchers well, since they provide easy computerized access (searching, cut and paste) to materials previously only found in print. Research limitations/implications: There is a dichotomy of feelings represented in the literature on the transition of journals from print to electronic. Most of the literature seems to indicate that the move to electronic journals is good for researchers. Practical implications: The move to electronic resources will provide a rich base of digital literature that was not available to researchers before, and this will result in upgraded efforts at publication. Searching electronically can be an enormous timesaver and provides a previously unknown range of searching. Originality/value: The research includes examples of what experts in the field suggest to resolve this issue. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Electronic journals; Paper; Transition management",,,,,,,"Boeri, R., News to go: Paper or digital?

This is aided by a further quest, to establish firm groundwork for a neo-Schumpeterian theory of economic geography based upon his theorisation of the key roles of innovation and entrepreneurship in regional development. These two perspectives fit together rather seamlessly conceptually and in the empirical case material drawn from the USA and Europe. The results point to the centrality of geographical space in the formation not only of paradigms of regime change in industrial organisation but also of more thoroughgoing transitions from one socio-technical landscape, within which many technological regimes may have been subject to 'creative destruction', to another coevolutionary landscape that may be the setting for the next set of, in this case, successive post-hydrocarbon technological regimes. Observation of potential landscape change of the kind in focus in the paper is rare, and the conclusions do not go much beyond the identification of the first key elements from which the grander regime and landscape transitions may be consequent. © 2010 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Green technology; Innovation systems; Market niche; Technological cycle; Transition regions",,,,,,,,"Cooke, P.; Centre for Advanced Studies, Cardiff University, 44-45 Park Place, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3BB, United Kingdom; email: cookepn@cf.ac.uk",,,,,,,,18687865,,,10.1007/s13132-010-0019-2,,"English","Journal of the Knowledge Economy",Article in Press,Scopus

This might partly be related to the fact that men in general consume medical services only half as often as women. Up to 90 % of all suicides are committed in a state of a major psychiatric disorder, most often depression. According to the present doctrine, depression in males is only half as often prevalent as in females. Paradoxically, however, men commit suicide 3-10 times more often than women in spite of being diagnosed only half as often as women as clinically depressed. Male premature mortality reflected even in excessive male suicidality is today one of Europe's most important public health problems, especially in European countries and populations of dramatic social transition. An explanation seems to be that male depressive symptoms are different from those reported by females, mainly because of men's alexithymic difficulties to recognize and report their own depressive symptoms. In addition, male depression often is manifested by abusive, destructive, and/or antisocial behaviour. Moreover, in the case of suicidality, males more frequently use violent, decisive, and lethal methods. Training of social and healthcare workers in earlier and better detection of male depressive and often very suicidal conditions including the use of screening instruments such as the ""Gotland Male Depression Scale"", a person-centered approach in suicide prevention as well as increasing public awareness for male depression are promising tools in the prevention of male suicide as an important public health problem.","Depression; Educational programs on depression and suicide; Gender-specific psychopathology; Gender-specific suicidality; Male depression; Male mortality; Male suicide; Premature mortality; Primary health care; Societal transition; Suicide; Suicide prevention","antisocial behavior; depression; Europe; human; male; review; suicide",,,,,,"Qin, P., Agerbo, E., Westergard-Nielsen, N., Eriksson, T., Mortensen, P.B., Gender differences in risk factors for suicide in Denmark (2000) British Journal of Psychiatry, 177 (DEC), pp. 546-550. , DOI 10.1192/bjp.177.6.546; (2005) Health for All (HFA) Database, , World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Office for Europe Copenhagen; Kyprianou, K., Opening speech (2005) Presentation of the European Union's Green Book on Mental Health, , European Commission, Luxembourg; (2005) Green Book on Mental Health, , European Commission.

We study four technological routes that the ""Platform Sustainable Mobility"" has selected for this goal: (1) hybridization of vehicles, (2) liquid biofuels, (3) natural gas as a transportation fuel and (4) hydrogen as a transportation fuel. These technological routes all envision large-scale changes in vehicle propulsion technology and fuel infrastructure. Furthermore, they compete for the scarce resources available to invest in new (fuel) infrastructures, which implicates that these 'transition paths' are also interdependent at the level of the mobility system. The main outcome of the analysis is the identification of barriers that are currently blocking the transition toward sustainable mobility. Barriers are classified as being related to (1) technology and vehicle development, (2) the availability of (fuel) infrastructures, and (3) elements of the institutional infrastructure. The transition management framework currently misses guidelines for coping with (competing) technologies that each require large infrastructural investments. We further argue that avoiding undesired lock-ins and creating a beneficial institutional context for sustainable mobility cannot be pursued at the transition path level. Therefore, we recommend that a more systemic approach should be taken to the transition to sustainable mobility, in which the interdependencies between the transition paths are critically assessed and in which the possibilities to legitimize sustainable mobility as a whole should be used. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Barriers; Innovation; Sustainable Mobility; Transition management","Barriers; In-vehicle; Liquid biofuels; Mobility systems; Netherlands; Scarce resources; Sustainable mobility; Sustainable transportation systems; Systemic approach; Technological route; Transition management; Transition paths; Transportation fuels; Vehicle development; Fuels; Investments; Transportation routes; Natural gas transportation; fuel consumption; hydrogen; innovation; mobility; resource scarcity; sustainable development; technological change; technological development; transportation policy; transportation system; Netherlands",,,,,,"Deakin, E., Sustainable Development and Sustainable Transportation: Strategies for Economic Prosperity, Environmental Quality, and Equity (2001) IURD Working Series Paper, , UC Berkeley, Dept. of City and Regional Planning and UC Transportation Center, Berkeley, CA; (2001) Mobility 2001.

The driving question of this paper is whether infrasystems which are inherently rigid and hard to change radically are likely to block desired transitions to sustainability, or that there are pathways in which infrasystem changes might be utilized as drivers for accelerating desired transitions. Based on synthesizing insights from research on infrastructures and on transitions, we present a typology for identifying different types of infrasystems (infrasystem architectures), what underlies infrasystem complexity (infrasystem interplays), and how infrasystems might respond to change in the form of alternative pathways. Our exploratory effort draws together different literatures in order to formulate a number of guiding conceptualizations and transition strategies for further debate and experiment. Our analysis suggests that an infrasystem transition depends on infrasystem architecture and on actors (regulators, planners versus users) given the multi-actor setting of infrasystems. We show that the transition management approach offers interesting insights when analyzing infrasystem change and that the topic of infrasystem transitions is highly relevant and needs to be further explored within the transitions field. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Complexity; Dynamics; Infrastructures; Planning; Transition management","Complexity; Infrastructures; Lock-in; Transition management; Planning; complexity; infrastructural development; infrastructure planning; sustainability; typology",,,,,,"Frantzeskaki, N., de Haan, H., Transitions: two steps from theory to policy (2009) Futures, 41, pp. 593-606; Rotmans, J., Kemp, R., van Asselt, M., More evolution than revolution (2001) Foresight, 3 (1), pp. 1-17; Geels, F.W., Processes and patterns in transitions and system innovations: refining the co-evolutionary multi-level perspective (2005) Technol.

One aspect of such transition processes that is emphasized in transition management is learning about user behaviour and preferences. However, while earlier research on sustainable mobility acknowledges the importance of refuelling infrastructure, the question of how to unroll such an infrastructure and the role of user practices and user behaviour largely remains unanswered. In this paper we present an agent-based model to study the process of development from niche to market for hydrogen vehicles. We thereby focus on the role of users in this process and support our model by empirical data. Within this model the effects of different strategies for hydrogen infrastructure development on hydrogen vehicle fleet penetration are studied. More specifically, diffusion patterns for hydrogen vehicles are created through the interactions of consumers, refuelling stations and technological learning. The main result is that social network effects do influence the technological trajectory of hydrogen vehicles and thus should be taken into account by infrastructure developers and policymakers. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Agent-based modeling; Hydrogen; Infrastructure development; Technological change","Agent-based model; Agent-based modeling; Diffusion patterns; Empirical data; Hydrogen infrastructure; Hydrogen vehicles; Infrastructure development; Policy framework; Policy makers; Social Networks; Sustainable mobility; Sustainable transport systems; Technological change; Technological learning; Technological trajectories; Transition management; Transition process; User behaviour; User practices; Computational methods; Fleet operations; Planning; Vehicles; Hydrogen; development strategy; hydrogen; infrastructural development; mobility; numerical model; sustainable development; technological development; transport vehicle; transportation system; Netherlands",,,,,,"Kemp, R., Rotmans, J., Loorbach, D., Assessing the Dutch energy transition policy: how does it deal with dilemmas of managing transitions (2007) Journal of Environmental Policy and Planning, 9 (3-4), pp. 315-331; Loorbach, D., (2007) Transition management: new mode of governance for sustainable development, , (Utrecht: International Books); Kemp, R., Rotmans, J., Managing the transition to sustainable mobility (2004) System Innovation and the Transition to Sustainability: Theory, Evidence and Policy, pp. 137-167. , (Cheltenham: Edward Elgar), E.

The paper considers ""transition"" as a shift from one socio-economic ""dreamworld"" to another, rather than as a real change towards freedom and democracy, as most mainstream commentators would have it. The argument is that this ""transition"" to a capitalist, free market society was bound up with a host of dream-like imaginations of social and economic progress, which were also found on the imaginary horizon of the Soviet system. It is argued that the two systems, and hence also the recent global capitalist crisis, can be understood as being determined by complementary economies of desires, which, however, cannot be fulfilled. Design/methodology/approach: The paper combines a critical theory perspective, influenced by Buck-Morss and Benjamin, with a Lacanian analysis of subjectivity to critically analyze collective fantasies as the key organizational principle behind the workings and eventual demise of the socialist utopia as well as the more recent downfall of the neoliberal discourse. Findings: The paper demonstrates why both socialism and capitalism can be understood as ""real existing"" systems where social processes, institutions, ideologies and identities are organized at the interface of political-agonistic and symbolic-imaginary dimensions. Social implications: The paper calls for assuming responsibility for our work as public intellectuals and academics, aiming at the continuous unmasking of illusions, fantasies and ideologies at work in society, which we see as politics proper. Originality/value: The paper uses critical-theoretic, psychoanalytic and post-structuralist frames in order to unravel the fantasmatic kernel at work of both socialist and capitalist utopias. These fantasies do not only struggle to uphold their hegemonic grip on the economy but on the very production of subjectivity. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic conditions; Social economics; Transition management",,,,,,,"Banerjee, B., Necrocapitalism (2008) Organization Studies, 29 (12), pp. 1541-1563; (2010) Landslide victory for Hungary's conservative opposition, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8642456.stm, BBC, 25 April, available at (accessed 23 May 2010); Benjamin, W., (1999) The Arcades Project, , (trans.

Some federal and local government initiatives addressing the limitations of risk-based approaches are introduced. We argue that conventional risk-based approaches to adaptation, largely focused on hazard identification and quantitative modelling, will be inadequate on their own for dealing with the challenges of climate change. We suggest that responses to climate change adaptation should move beyond conventional riskbased strategies to more realistically account for complex and dynamically evolving social-ecological systems. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Adaptation; Adaptive management; Australia; Climate change; Local government; Resilience; Risk; Vulnerability assessment","adaptive management; climate change; critical analysis; decision making; governance approach; local government; risk assessment; vulnerability; Australia",,,,,,"Adger, W.N., Social-ecological resilience to coastal disasters (2005) Science, 309 (5737), pp. 1036-1039; (2005) Climate change risk and vulnerability, , AGO (Australian Greenhouse Office), Final report prepared by The Allen Consulting Group.

The project aims (a) to learn from past transitions to help explore future transitions and what might enable or avoid them; (b) to design and evaluate transition pathways towards alternative socio-technical energy systems and infrastructures for a low carbon future; and (c) to understand and, where appropriate, model the changing roles, influences and opportunities of large and small 'actors' in the dynamics of transitions. The paper describes the approach, which builds on the work of Dutch researchers on transitions and transition management using a multi-level framework of niches, socio-technical regime and landscape, as well as on other parts of the innovation systems literature. It also describes its application to several outline transition pathways to a low carbon energy system in the UK. The pathways embrace both the evolution of the physical and institutional infrastructure changes and the roles of both large actors, e.g. multinational energy supply and distribution companies, national governments, major investors, and small actors, e.g. households, innovators and entrepreneurs. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Dynamic processes; Multi-level perspective; Technological innovation systems; Transition pathways; UK energy system","Dynamic process; Energy systems; Multi-level; Technological innovation; Transition pathway; Research; Technological forecasting; Innovation; alternative fuel; carbon; development project; electricity supply; infrastructural development; innovation; technological change; Netherlands; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Rip, A., Kemp, R., Technological change (1998) Human Choices and Climate Change, 2. , Battelle Press, Columbus, Ohio, S.

Their very nature of autonomy and high level of professionalism has aided them to be very innovative. Their founder managers, few equipped with professional experience(s) and few exposed to family owned (professional) business have shaped a niche in themselves. The objective of this study was to explore the innovative enterprise and its characteristics along with the nature of innovation. Enterprises that exhibited some kind of innovation or were engaged in deploying innovative practices were identified from 200 published cases and were classified under three different categories. The identified innovative enterprises have been classified as chimp type (start-ups <5 years), hyena type (>=5 and <15 years) and lion type (>=15 years) innovative enterprise (metaphor used for these animal representative of the description used). Their typical characteristics as an innovative enterprise possessed, competing for existence (survival) and business (hunting), similar to a chimp, hyena and a lion for its survival, have been compared as a result of transition. The researcher attempts to relay better understanding on the transition process and what constitutes a winning enterprise.

Drawing on both institutional theory, managerial control theory, and innovation theory, this study examines the roles of external and internal drivers to firms' radical innovation. Specifically, we examine the effects of external institutional environment and internal corporate governance on radical innovation by introducing management control systems. Based on data from a sample of 585 firms in China, this study finds that the effect of institutional environment uncertainty on radical innovation is significant but formal corporate governance is not. These results suggest that firms facing an uncertain institutional environment emphasize both financial control and strategic control, and firms that have adopted formal corporate governance prefer strategic control to financial control. The implications of these findings for research during institutional transitions are discussed. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","China; Formal corporate governance; Institutional environment uncertainty; Institutional transitions; Management control systems; Radical innovation",,,,,,,,"Liu, Y.; Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200052, China; email: liuyi76@sjtu.edu.cn",,,,,,,,02174561,,,10.1007/s10490-010-9231-7,,"English","Asia Pacific Journal of Management",Article in Press,Scopus

He also helped to revitalize public outreach and member services, among many other efforts. Van Hook, president of Transition Management Consulting, recently reflected upon his tenure, the transition period, and the future of AGU.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper was based on the data collected from face-to-face interviews with 585 firm founders. The contribution of firms to job creation was computed by using descriptive statistics and then an ordinal logit regression model was employed to explore the determinants of fast growth. Findings: Results indicate that the contribution of fast-growing firms to employment in this environment is lower than that in Western and developed countries. Findings also suggest that fast growth is positively affected by specific human capital, intentions to grow and the ability to deal with external barriers, while having a university degree is found to be negatively related to fast growth. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides a better understanding of the phenomenon of fast-growing firms and has several theoretical and practical implications. Importantly, the research on fast-growing firm is still not mature and the overall picture on fast-growing firms have yet to be built. Originality/value: Most of the empirical evidence on fast-growing firms comes from developed countries. This paper provides the empirical evidence from a transitional yet extreme context to further our knowledge on the topic of firm's fast growth. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business development; Companies business environment; Employment; Transition management; Western Europe",,,,,,,"Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., (1990) Innovation and Small Firms, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Acs, Z.J., Mueller, P., Employment effects of business dynamics: Mice, gazelles and elephants (2008) Small Business Economics, 30 (1), pp. 85-100; Aidis, R., Institutional barriers to small and medium sized enterprise development in transition countries (2005) Small Business Economics, 25 (4), pp. 305-318; Almus, M., What characterizes a fast growing firm?

Scholars have argued that experiments could point the way forward towards sustainable mobility (cf. Loorbach, 2007, Markard and Truffer, 2008). In doing so, literature attributes a vital but complex task to those who engage in experiments. However, an important knowledge gap pertains to whether and how experiments contribute to learning about transitions and in what way they should be managed to break-up the more or less inertial mobility governance system. This paper aims to analyze how state-of-the-art literature on the governance of multi-actor systems considers experiments to contribute to transitions and highlight key dilemma's that professionals engaged in the management of experimental face in the day-to-day management and decision making processes during the experiment. The paper will highlight these dilemmas and choices and illustrate their importance for experiments in the field of transportation and more specifically in the specific context of the Dutch mobility system and the TRANSUMO research program. Identifying these dilemma's benefits practitioners who are engaged in the management of experiments to more consciously reflect on and include issues of second-order learning in the day-to-day management and decision making during the experiment to reach a more sustainable mobile system.","Experiment; Multi-actor governance; Project management; Transition management","Break-up; Complex task; Decision making process; Governance systems; Knowledge gaps; Mobile systems; Mobility systems; Multi-actor governance; Multi-actor systems; Research programs; Second orders; Sustainable mobility; Transition management; Experiments; Project management; Decision making",,,,,,"Avelino, F., Empowerment and the challenge of applying transition management to ongoing projects (2009) Policy Sciences, 42, pp. 369-390; Brown, H.S., Vergragt, P., Green, K., Berchicci, L., Learning for Sustainability Transition through Bounded Socio-technical Experiments in Personal Mobility (2003) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 15, pp. 291-315; Brown, H.S., Vergragt, P.J., Bounded socio-technical experiments as agents of systemic change: The case of a zero-energy residential building (2008) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 75, pp. 107-130; De Bruijn, H., van der Voort, H., Dicke, W., De Jong, M., Veeneman, W., (2004) Creating System Innovation, How large scale transitions emerge, , Leiden, A.A.

As a result, an increasing number of users are accessing applications and services while travelling, especially on public transportation systems, thus giving rise to group mobility scenarios. Therefore, it is essential for the NGMN to be equipped with group mobility management support for achieving seamless session handoffs for a group of users or devices moving together. For a group of members moving between two networks, location transition management was initially addressed in the Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) NEtwork MObility (NEMO) basic support protocol. However, the two networks in this case are homogeneous in nature. This paper proposes the integration of NEMO support for an NGMN architecture for enabling group mobility management between multiple heterogeneous networks. Results and analysis illustrate that by integrating NEMO support to an NGMN reduces handoff latency, transient packet loss, jitter, and signaling cost for both end users and service providers. ©2010 IEEE.","CDMA2000; IMS; MIP-NEMO; Mobile IP; NEMO; Network mobility; SIP; SIP-NEMO; UMTS; WiMAX","Cdma2000; End users; Group mobility; Handoff Latency; Internet engineering task forces; Interworking; MIP-NEMO; Mobile IP; Mobile networks; Network mobility; Public transportation systems; Service provider; Signaling costs; Transition management; Ubiquitous Service; Code division multiple access; Cost reduction; Heterogeneous networks; Integration; Internet protocols; Interoperability; Jitter; Mobile telecommunication systems; Packet networks; Wimax; Wireless networks",,,,,,"Lach, H.Y., Janneteau, C., Petrescu, A., Network mobility in beyond-3G systems (2003) IEEE Communications Magazine, 41 (7), pp. 52-57. , Jul; Devarapalli, V., (2005) Network Mobility Basic Support Protocol, , IETF RFC 3963, Jan; Perera, E., Sivaraman, V., Seneviratne, A., A Survey on Network Mobility Support (2004) Mobile Computing and Communications Review, 8; Huang, C.M., Lee, C.H., Zheng, J.R., A novel SIP based route optimization for network mobility (2006) IEEE Journal in Selected Areas in Communications, 24 (9), pp. 1682-1691. , Sept; Chiang, W.K., Ren, A.N., Chung, Y.C., Integrating SIPbased Network Mobility into IP Multimedia Subsystem Proceedings of the IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking, Budapest, Hungry, Apr. 2009; Varma, V.K., Mobility management in integrated UMTS/WLAN networks Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, Anchorage, Alaska, May 2003; Munasinghe, K.S., Jamalipour, A., A Unified Mobility and Session Management Platform for Next Generation Mobile Networks Proceedings of the IEEE Globecom, Washington DC, Nov. 2007; Huang, C.M., Lee, C.H., Tseng, P.H., Multihomed SIP-based Network Mobility Using IEEE 802.21 Media Independet Handover Proceedings of the IEEE Communications Conference, Dresden, Germany, Jun. 2009; Camarillo, G., Roach, A., (2007) Framework and Security Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)-List Services, , draft-ietf-sipping-uriservices- 07, Nov; (2005) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), , 3GPP, 3GPP TS 23.228 Version 6.10.0 Release 6; (2000) Combined GSM and Mobile IP Mobility Handling in UMTS IP CN, , 3GPP, 3GPP TR 23.923 v 3.0.0; Perkins, C., (2002) IP Mobility Support for IPv4, , IETF RFC 3344; Enrique Vazquez, A.H., Fernandez, J.I., (2005) SIP-IMS Model for OPNET Modeler, , OPNET University Program Contributed Models; Munasinghe, K.S., Jamalipour, A., A 3GPP-IMS based Approach for Converging Next Generation Mobile Data Networks Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, Glasgow, UK, Jun. 2007","Munasinghe, K.

It then relates this concept to current policy concerns about climate change and energy and presents research results about what a low-carbon energy system might look like and how it could be achieved. It then briefly explores the policy implications and possible macro-economic costs of moving to a low-carbon energy system. Technological transitions are relevant to climate change and energy because the energy system is a major technological system in society, and to reduce its carbon emissions dramatically, as is required if dangerous anthropogenic climate change is to be avoided, will require a full technological transition. There are many low-carbon technologies with the potential for large-scale deployment. Simulations suggest that the decarbonisation of the electricity system, involving any or all of carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and renewables, with increasing use of electricity in the residential and transport sectors, will be required. There may also be a role for bioenergy and hydrogen. In all cases strong public policies will be required to achieve large cuts in carbon emissions, involving carbon pricing, technology support and removing barriers to lifestyle and behaviour changes. Currently, while many different policies have been implemented, they have not been strongly enough applied to achieve sustained emissions reduction. Most models suggest that the macroeconomic costs of substantial cuts in carbon emissions are relatively small (1-4% GDP by 2050) compared to the costs of unabated dimate change. However, the political costs of implementing the required policies may mean that politicians are unable in practice to prevent runaway climate change.",,,,,,,,"Adamson, K.A., Calculating the price trajectory of adoption of fuel cell vehicles (2005) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 30 (4), pp. 341-350; Anandarajah, G., Strachan, N., Ekins, P., Kannan, R., Hughes, N., (2008) Pathways to a Low-Carbon Economy: Energy Systems Modelling, , http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/, UKERC Energy 2050 Research Report 1, Ref.

We contend that if we want to understand such transitions, we need to understand policy change and its opposite, policy stability. These issues have attracted considerable academic attention. Our interest is, however, very specific and thereby unique: we review the role that (groups of) individuals play in the process of preparing, instigating, and implementing policy change. In this article, a review of the literature on policy change provides the basis from which we extract a set of strategies which are available to policy entrepreneurs. The questions for the rest of this special feature are first, can we detect the influence of policy entrepreneurs in actual cases of major policy change, and second, which strategies have they actually used to affect policy change? © 2010 by the author(s).","Case studies; Policy change; Policy entrepreneurs; Transition management; Water management","entrepreneur; policy implementation; policy reform; policy strategy; water management",,,,,,"Alley, R.B., Clark, P.U., Huybrechts, P., Joughin, I., Ice-sheet and sea-level changes (2005) Science, 310 (5747), pp. 456-460; Anckar, C., On the applicability of the most similar systems design and the most different systems design in comparative research (2008) International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 11 (5), pp. 389-401; Bachrach, P., Baratz, M.S., (1970) Power And Poverty; Theory And Practice, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK; Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., Agenda dynamics and policy subsystems (1991) Journal of Politics, 53 (4), pp. 1044-1074; (2002) Policy Dynamics, , Baumgartner, F.

The central questions are to what extent have policy entrepreneurs played a role in realizing major change in water policies, who are these policy entrepreneurs, and what strategies have they used to bring about change? The policy science literature suggests that policy entrepreneurs have an arsenal of possible strategies for achieving change. Based on a comparative analysis of water policy changes in 15 countries around the globe and the European Union, we investigate which strategies have in practice been used by policy entrepreneurs, to what effect, and which lessons for managing water transitions we can draw from this. The comparative case analysis shows that individuals play complementary roles; hence, entrepreneurship in water management is often collective entrepreneurship. Strategies of coalition building, the manipulation of decision making forums, and the strategic framing of issues and windows are crucial to understanding water policy change, which suggests that the management of water policy transitions is a highly political game. We conclude by listing recommendations for those who would like to direct water policy change. © 2010 by the author(s).","Change strategies; International comparison; Policy change; Policy entrepreneurs; Transition management; Water management","comparative study; decision making; entrepreneur; European Union; policy approach; strategic approach; water management; water planning",,,,,,"Anckar, C., On the applicability of the most similar systems design and the most different systems design in comparative research (2008) International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 11, pp. 389-401; Baumgartner, F.R., Berry, J.M., Hojnacki, M., Kimball, D.C., Leech, B.L., Lobbying and policy change.

In particular, young persons with migrant backgrounds, low academic achievement or missing school graduations need special help from ""Managing transition"" projects. The purpose of this paper is to present some findings from a formative evaluation of a mentoring project. Design/methodology/approach: The evaluation of the mentoring programme was done in a case study manner. A formative evaluation design with a three-part survey was chosen. The survey also used standardised questionnaires as oral interviews. Findings: In the survey, it could be found that the mentoring programme had many problems to overcome. For example, it did not succeed in building a continuous and trustworthy communication between mentors and pupils. Moreover, the pupils were unsuccessful in getting an apprenticeship training position despite overcoming lethargy in order to start applying. Furthermore, the mentors felt insufficiently prepared with regards to content and methodological design of the mentoring. Research limitations/implications: Considering the small sample (six students and eight mentors), it was quite clear that the evaluation study could not generate a representative analysis. The research should be regarded as an explorative case study only. Practical implications: As a result of the formative evaluation, some recommendations are given that should optimise the continuation and extension of the mentoring programme. Originality/value: The findings of this mentoring programme are useful for people planning to start similar projects because practical problems and possible solutions are mentioned. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Germany; Immigration; Jobs; School leavers; Transition management; Uncertainty management",,,,,,,"Balzer, L., (2005), ""Wie werden Evaluationsprojekte erfolgreich?"", Ein integrierender theoretischer Ansatz und eine empirische Studie zum Evaluationsprozess, LandauBeicht, U., Ulrich, J.G., The course of training and the transition to employment.

We contend that the sharing of lessons between these areas of study must attend particularly to the common governance challenges that confront both approaches. Here, we focus on critical experience arising from reactions to a transition management approach to governing sustainable socio-technical transformations. Questions over who governs, whose system framings count, and whose sustainability gets prioritized are all pertinent to social-ecological systems research. We conclude that future research in both areas should deal more centrally and explicitly with these inherently political dimensions of sustainability.

In order to avoid these effects, one, or a number of technological transitions will need to take place through transforming processes of eco-innovation, which have complex political, institutional and cultural, in addition to technological and economic, dimensions. Measurement systems need to be devised that can assess to what extent eco-innovation is taking place. Environmental and eco-innovation have already led in a number of European countries to the establishment of substantial eco-industries, but, because of the general absence of environmental considerations in markets, these industries are very largely the result of environmental public policies, the nature and effectiveness of which have now been assessed through a number of reviews and case studies. The paper concludes that such policies will need to become much more stringent if eco-innovation is to drive an adequately far-reaching technological transition to resolve pressing environmental challenges. Crucial in the political economy of this change will be that eco-industries, supported by public opinion, are able to counter the resistance of established industries which will lose out from the transition, in a reformed global context where international treaties and co-operation prevent the relocation of environmentally destructive industries and encourage their transformation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Eco-industries; Eco-innovation; Environmental sustainability; Innovation policies; Technological transitions",,,,,,,"Aghion, P., Veugelers, R., Serre, C., (2009) Cold Start for the 'Green innovation machine', Bruegel Policy Contribution, , http://www.bruegel.org/uploads/tx_btbbreugel/pc_climateparvcs_231109.pdf, Issue 2009/12, November, Bruegel, Brussels, accessed April 8 2010; Aghion, P., Hemous, D., Veugelers, R., (2009) No green growth without innovation, , http://www.bruegel.org/uploads/tx_btbbreugel/pb_climatervpa_231109_01.pdf, Bruegel Policy Brief, Issue 2009/07, November, Bruegel, Brussels, accessed April 8 2010; Anderson, D., (2001) Innovation and the Environment: Challenges & Policy Options for the UK, , London: Imperial College Centre for Energy Policy and Technology & the Fabian Society; Ashford, N.A., Government and environmental innovation in Europe and North America (2005) Towards Environmental Innovation Systems, pp. 159-174. , M.

First, we explicate the process of 'making' the informal sector in terms of the formal sector. Derived from a centrist logic that shapes the mainstream development paradigm, this involves a process of its devaluation in terms of the norm of the formal sector. Moreover, attempts to introduce heterogeneity within an already homogeneously defined informal sector are shown to be failing. Second, we show how placing the concept of the informal sector within the non-centric class-focused economic terrain fundamentally displaces, indeed 'unmakes', the received definition of the informal sector. Our analytical frame of a non-centric class-focused economic terrain reveals, on one hand, how the 'making' of the informal sector serves as a political rationale for shaping societal transition in favor of modern capitalism, and on the other, the problematical nature of the rationality. © The Author(s), 2010.","Centrism; Class; Heterogeneity; Informal sector; Overdetermination; Process",,,,,,,"Bienefeld, M., The Informal Sector and Peripheral Capitalism: The Case of Tanzania (1975) Institute of Development Studies Bulletin, 6 (3), pp. 53-73; Breman, J., A Dualistic Labor System?

This paper seeks to develop a competency typology that integrates previous definitions and frameworks from the literature and to propose a methodology for identifying competencies to aid the transition from a task-based to a competency-based logic for human resource management. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a longitudinal research project. The paper outlines a methodology and presents the findings from the implementation of a competency model in two case companies. It illustrates how the systematic use of the identified competency categories can support the identification and coding of competencies, which will facilitate the critical organizational transformation from a task-based to a competency-based approach. Findings: The experience from the deployment offers potential challenges of implementing this framework in a specific cultural context. It identifies critical enablers that will contribute to successful implementation, whilst also providing insights concerning predicaments that have to be met. Originality/value: The particular competency typology integrates previous definitions and frameworks from the literature, thus providing a holistic solution for supporting the implementation of a competency-based approach. Furthermore, through the analysis of the implementation of the competency framework in two case companies it serves as the basis for illustrating the main steps, as well as the critical success factors that characterize such projects. Finally, it demonstrates the advantages of integrating the proposed competency framework and offers managerial insights and guidelines for similar implementations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competences; Competitive advantage; Critical thinking; Human resource management; Organizational effectiveness; Transition management",,,,,,,"Alderson, S., Reframing management competence: Focusing on the top management team (1993) Personnel Review, 22 (6), pp. 53-62; Armstrong, M., (2001) A Handbook of Human Resource Management Practice, , Prentice-Hall, London; Athey, T.R., Orth, M.S., Emerging competency methods for the future (1999) Human Resource Management, 38 (3), pp. 215-225; Bartram, D., The great eight competencies: A criterion-centric approach to validation (2005) Journal of Applied Psychology, 90 (6), pp. 1185-1203; Bass, M.B., From transactional to transformational leadership to share the vision (1996) Motivation and Leadership at Work, , Steers, R.M.

To that end, the article discusses seven social science ontologies (rational choice, evolution theory, structuralism, interpretivism, functionalism, conflict and power struggle, relationism), their assumptions on agency and causal mechanisms, and their views on socio-technical transitions and environmental sustainability. The second goal is to position the multi-level perspective on transitions with regard to these ontologies and to identify directions for theoretical extensions. The MLP is characterized not as a grand or unifying theory, but as a middle range theory that makes crossovers to some ontologies and not to others. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

And how would we know if they were? There are three key objectives. The first of these is to set out emerging, and in our view, convincing evidence, that large world cities have political aspirations to develop purposive and managed change in the socio-technical organisation of infrastructure networks that can be characterised as 'systemic' transitions. The second objective is conceptual in orientation and seeks to address how we understand transitions at the scale of the city, the role of 'the city' in undertaking transitions, and review both the strengths and shortcomings of the multi-level perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions in addressing this. The third objective is to identify what an urban transition would look like, and then constructs a new framework to conceptualise and research urban transitions. The paper then summarises the key aspects and implications of our argument. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This review paper contributes three things towards this re-assessment activity. First, it considers how the history of innovation studies for sustainable development can be explained as a process of linking broader analytical frameworks to successively larger problem framings. Second it introduces an emerging framework whose allure rests in its ability to capture the bigger picture: the multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions (MLP). Whilst burgeoning researcher networks and literature suggests this policy-relevant theory is attractive, it is not without its challenges. The third purpose of this paper is to elaborate these challenges as areas for further research and development.

In this paper we seek to extend the scope of debate, introducing aspects of practice theory as a means of also conceptualising the dynamics of demand. Rather than treating 'human need' or 'societal functions' as given, we consider how variously sustainable practices come into existence, how they disappear and how interventions of different forms may be implicated in these dynamics. We use the two cases of daily showering and the congestion charging scheme in London to consider the distinctive challenges of understanding transitions in practice and of governing these so as to engender more sustainable ways of life. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The term socio-technical system is a conceptual reminder that technologies affect and are an effect of their broader infrastructural, organizational, regulatory, and symbolic environments. As explained, there was no single "" cause"" driving this transition. Rather, dynamics at different levels came together and reinforced each other. When taken together, these transitions had the cumulative effect of propelling the ethanol juggernaut to the heights of today. The author analytically breaks down the automobile socio-technical system and examines transitions that occurred in its various dimensions. While not predictive, the socio-technical framework reminds us of influential path-dependent logics. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of where, in light of these realities, the biofuels trajectory may be headed in the not-too-distant future. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Automobiles; Biofuels; Ethanol; Path dependency; Science and technology studies; Socio-technical system; Technological change","Cumulative effects; Path dependency; Science and technology studies; Sociotechnical; Sociotechnical systems; Symbolic environment; Technological change; Technology; Ethanol; alternative fuel; automobile; biofuel; conceptual framework; energy market; ethanol; industrial development; market transition; science and technology; technology adoption; United States",,,,,,"Industry statistics, , http://www.ethanolrfa.org/industry/statistics/%23A, Available from:, [accessed 18.09.08], Renewable Fuels Association; Kovarik, B., Henry Ford, Charles F.

'Energy regions' in Austria are an interesting example for the strategic promotion of such guiding visions in the context of regional development. We describe the case of Murau, an alpine district in which a strong actor network has been built around a vision of systematically exploiting renewable energy sources and at the same time saving the region from economic decay. The vision gained much authority and has been institutionalised at various levels of regional governance. It furthermore was supported by and played an important role for regime level attempts to influence socio-technical change. Development and social propagation of such visions are inherently political and contested processes involving much strategizing and anticipation of conflict. We describe particular discursive strategies applied in niches - such as the combination and translation of sentiments into localised visions and demonstrations of feasibility. These strategies can be understood as systematic attempts to support discursive shifts at regime level by means of local activities, and aim to modify rather durable power structures. We suggest ways to analyse such discursive practices in order to orient strategic action in the course of such processes: analysing 'guiding visions' and their interference with other emerging trends; extending analyses across spatial scales (e.g. translations) and across thematic fields (e.g. convergence of agendas); and focusing on processes of stabilisation, institutionalisation and mutually reinforcing developments. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using the real option reasoning lens we provide a theoretical framework to better account for the technological and market uncertainties and irreversibilities that impact the investment and innovation decisions of automotive firms supporting the development of more sustainable vehicle technologies. We investigate the case of hybrid vehicles in a transitional perspective by insisting on their potential to influence the dynamic shaping of investment decisions of firms in the car industry. We consider the hybridization strategy as intra-project and inter-project compound growth options to manage the flexibilities and irreversibilities of investment decisions during the transition process. We provide four different-sometimes conflicting-strategic rationales structuring the investment efforts of firms in hybrid vehicles and illustrate them with numerous examples from the automotive industry. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Hybrid vehicle; Investment strategy; Real options; Sustainable transport; Technological transition","Hybrid vehicles; Investment strategy; Real Options; Sustainable transport; Technological transition; Automotive industry; Climate change; Ground vehicles; Land vehicle propulsion; Strategic planning; Investments; automobile industry; corporate strategy; innovation; investment; sustainability; technological development",,,,,,"Hekkert, M., Van den Hoed, R., Competing technologies and the struggle towards a new dominant design: the emergence of the hybrid vehicle at the expense of the fuel cell vehicle (2006) Greener Management International, 47, pp. 29-47; Raven, R., Niche accumulation and hybridisation strategies in transition processes towards a sustainable energy system: an assessment of differences and pitfalls (2007) Energy Policy, 35 (4), pp. 2390-2400; Geels, F.W., Schot, J., Typology of socio-technical transition pathways (2007) Research Policy, 36 (3), pp. 399-417; Bowman, E.H., Hurry, D., Strategy through the option lens: an integrated view of resource investments and the incremental choice process (1993) Academy of Management Review, 18 (4), pp. 760-782; McGrath, R.G., A real options logic for initiating technology positioning investments (1997) Academy of Management Review, 22 (4), pp. 974-996; Kogut, B., Kulatilaka, N., Capabilities as real options (2001) Organization Science, 12 (6), pp. 744-758; Dixit, A.K., Pindyck, R.S., (1994) Investment Under Uncertainty, , Princton University Press, Princton, NJ; Trigeorgis, L., (1996) Real Options: Managerial Flexibility and Strategy in Resource Allocation, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Li, Y., James, B.E., Madhavan, R., Mahoney, J.T., Real options: taking stock and looking ahead (2007) Real Options Theory, Advances in Strategic Management, , Elsevier Ltd, J.J.

Recent research shows that experimenting in niches is crucial for learning about social challenges and stimulating transitions. Through a series of 'transition experiments' in different niches, social innovations can be improved and eventually replace dominant practice. This article reviews the literature on transitions and strategic niche management and argues that it has a strong analytical core, but less effort has been made to develop a managerial perspective. The authors aim to contribute to such perspective by developing a 'competence kit': a learning module that provides practitioners (e.g., policy makers, companies, intermediary organisations and NGO's) that are involved in transition experiments with an analytical framework, guidelines and tools and recognisable examples. The results from the first workshop with practitioners to explore potential applications of the competence kit are promising.

Because several prominent modes of transportation are widely regarded as systemically problematic, the notion of sustainable mobility has received considerable attention from the standpoint of system innovation. Sustainability though constitutes only one of many contemporary political objectives and public commitment to goals consistent with such a future is highly equivocal. A related challenge arises from the ambivalence that sustainability champions often harbor on an individual level. It is probable that efforts to facilitate sustainable mobility will need to be reconciled with rival societal aspirations such as the pursuit of faster and more convenient forms of travel. Drawing on insights from the multi-level perspective, this article contrasts the relatively static automobility system with its more dynamic aeromobility counterpart and explores why evidence of an incipient transition is more apparent within the realm of aviation. In particular, the diffusion of ""personal aeromobility"" involving the use of small airplanes for on-demand, point-to-point air travel raises perplexing questions for the governance of sustainable mobility. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While many Northern and Western European countries have shown a positive relationship between female education and second births, this pattern has not been found in Central and East European countries. Against that background, Estonia offers an interesting case with noticeably high second birth intensities for highly educated women. In the state socialist period, after controlling for the influence of other characteristics, including the partner's education, women with tertiary education were found to have higher second birth intensity than women from any lower educational strata. In the postsocialist period, the difference has grown smaller, but women with tertiary education still display a significantly higher transition rate to second birth than their counterparts with secondary education. Following the presentation of empirical findings, the article discusses the mechanisms that could underlie the observed relationship between education and fertility decisions in the changing societal context. The analysis employs microdata from the Estonian Generations and Gender Survey (GGS), conducted in 2004-05. © 2010.",,,,,,,,"Andersson, G., Rønsen, M., Knudsen, L.B., Lappegård, T., Neyer, G., Skrede, K., Teschner, K., Vikat, A., Cohort fertility patterns in the Nordic countries (2009) Demographic Research, 20 (14), pp. 313-352. , doi:10.4054/DemRes.2009.20.14; Aslund, A., (2007) How capitalism was built: The transformation of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and central Asia, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Becker, G.S., (1993) A treatise on the family, , Enlarged Edition.

The proposed methods are validated in simulation with a realistic dynamic model of a small helicopter. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Autonomous air vehicle; Helicopter; Robotics; Smooth speed; Trajectory","Autonomous air vehicle; Autonomous air vehicles; Autonomous helicopters; Direction change; Finite state machines; Flight mode transition; Flight schedules; Speed trajectories; Trajectory generation; Transition management; Logic circuits; Robotics; Trajectories; Helicopters",,,,,,"Agudelo-Toro, A., (2008) Trajectory Smoothing and Transition Management for A Small Autonomous Helicopter, , Master's thesis.

The common concern is to manage the transition in a way that lessens the socio-conomic side effects of the process. This paper presents policy recommendations for the Iranian cement industry, which will undergo such a transition. Building on the commodity model literature and supported by interviews with different stakeholders in the industry, we develop a cement price model and calibrate it for Iran's economy. In the base run, we predict a large overshoot in price before it reaches its long-term equilibrium state. Experimenting with the model, we suggest a specific transition policy which starts from drastic rise(s) in price before leaving the price up to the market. In addition, this paper gives some insights into analyzing similar economic policy problems. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"cement; commodity market; commodity price; management; manufacturing; market transition; stakeholder; Iran",,,,,,"Arquitt, S., Honggang, X., Johnstone, R., Boom and bust in the shrimp aquaculture industry (2005) System Dynamics Review, 21 (4), pp. 305-324; Brock, W.A., Hommes, C.H., Rational route to randomness (1997) Econometrica, 65, pp. 1059-1095; Chiarella, C., The cobweb-its instability and the onset of chaos (1988) Economic Modelling, 5, pp. 377-384; Day, R.H., Pavlov, O.V., Richard Goodwin's Keynesian cobweb: Theme and variations (2002) Journal of Macroeconomics, 24 (1), pp. 1-15; Endre, S., The political and economic transition in Hungary: Medi(t)ations, (re)conciliations (2004) Conflict Resolution and European Integration, pp. 85-90. , Ecumenical Anthology III, Blocksome R, Szabolcs N, S ̌ajda P (eds).

Transition management was developed in the course of this period in theoretical and practical sense, mainly in the Netherlands, as novel mode of governance for sustainable development. The theoretical debate about transition management is being increasingly published, but so far only few empirical examples were. In this article we present four cases that combined give a representative illustration of both the advantages and the difficulties of actually trying to manage transitions.

Available options such as biofuels, liquid hydrogen and electric propulsion will not only impact on the design and functionality of commercial airplanes, but also will affect the entire industry from supply through to operation and maintenance. However, on account of the global spread and international nature of aviation, in addition to the lock-in effect associated with existing fossil-fuel driven technology, the present aviation paradigm is not well equipped for a massive or rapid technological transition. This paper first provides an overview of selected available propulsion options, as well as their possible impact on the aviation infrastructure. It then sets out to identify the existing regime players in the aviation transition arena as a means to provide an overview of potential path trajectories, with a view to assessing how airport owners and other salient regime players can either facilitate or hinder the transition to alternative and less carbon-intensive technologies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"air transportation; airport; alternative fuel; future prospect; sustainability; technological change",,,,,,"Charles, M.B., Barnes, P., Ryan, N., Clayton, J., Airport futures: towards a critique of the aerotropolis model (2007) Futures, 39 (9), pp. 1009-1028; Zhang, A., Zhang, Y., Airport charges and capacity expansion: effects of concessions and privatization (2003) Journal of Urban Economics, 53 (1), pp. 54-75; Moriarty, P., Honnery, D., Low-mobility: the future of transport (2008) Futures, 40 (10), pp. 865-872; (2008) IATA Fact Sheet: Alternative Fuels, , International Aviation Transport Association; (2006) BITRE Freight Measurement and Modelling in Australia, , Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics, Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Canberra; (2008) IATA Building a Greener Future, , International Aviation Transport Association; (1999) IPCC IPCC Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Lapeña-Rey, N., Mosquera, J., Bataller, E., Ortí, F., Dudfield, C., Orsillo, A., Environmentally friendly power sources for aerospace applications (2008) Journal of Power Sources, 181 (2), pp. 353-362; EU, Opinion of the Commission Pursuant to Article 251(2), Third Subparagraph, Point (c) of the EC Treaty, on the European Parliament's Amendments to the Council's Common Position Regarding the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council Amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to Include Aviation Activities in the Scheme for Greenhouse Gas(2008) Australian Government Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: Australia's Low Pollution Future, , Department of Climate Change, Canberra; Kemp, K., (2006) Flight of the Titans: Boeing, Airbus and the Battle for the Future of Air Travel, , Virgin Books, London; Betz, F., (1998) Managing Technological Innovation: Competitive Advantage from Change, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Allen, J.E., Global energy issues affecting aeronautics: a reasoned conjecture (1999) Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 35 (5), pp. 413-453; Tidd, J., Bessant, J., Pavitt, K., (2001) Managing Innovation, , John Wiley & Sons; Babka, S., (2006) The A380 Debate, Morgan Stanley Research Europa, , Morgan Stanley & Co.

This article contributes to that goal by presenting a detailed study of the emergence of small-scale wood energy production practices in Finland. Given the distinctive and institutionally strong orientation of Finnish forestry towards raw material production for the pulp and paper industry, such innovative ways of using forest resources seem somewhat improbable and surprising. Despite this, we argue that the development of these new production practices can be understood as a process of institutional renewal that combines elements of continuity and novelty. In our empirical analysis, we follow the emergence of a new forest management category of ""young forest"" and explore how its naturalization as part of various institutional rules, identities and practices enabled the birth of local wood energy production within the forestry sector. In order to elucidate this multidimensional change, we analyze the new forest category as a boundary object, a socio-technical category with multiple functions and identities, within the large technological system of forestry.

Change management is a disciplined process for introducing required changes with minimum business impact. Considering the number of business processes in an enterprise and the complexity of the dependency network of processes to invoked services, one of the most pressing problems in change management is the risk-aware prioritization and scheduling of vast numbers of service changes. In this paper we introduce a model for estimating the business impact of operational risk resulting from changes. We determine the business impact based on the number and types of business process instances affected by a change-related outage and quantify the business impact in terms of financial loss. The model takes into account the network of dependencies between processes and services, probabilistic change-related downtime, uncertainty in business process demand, and various infrastructural characteristics. Based on the analytical model, we derive decision models aimed at scheduling single or multiple correlated changes with the lowest expected business impact. The models are evaluated using simulations based on industry data. © 2010 IEEE.","Business impact analysis; Change management; Change scheduling; Risk management; Service networks; Service transition management","Analytical model; Business impact; Business impact analysis; Business Process; Business requirement; Change management; Change scheduling; Cost drivers; Decision models; Financial loss; IT services; Operational risks; Prioritization; Related risk; Service disruptions; Information technology; Losses; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risk perception; Scheduling",,,,,,"Sauve, J.P., Santos, R.A., Almeida, R.R., Moura, J.A.B., On the risk exposure and priority determination of changes in IT service management (2007) Managing Virtualization of Networks and Services, 4785, pp. 147-158. , Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer; (2000) Service Support (IT Nfrastructure Library Series), , OGC, London UK:; The bottom line project: IT change management challenges-results of 2006 web survey (2006) Tech.

Sustainability issues at the level of societal sectors cannot be addressed by single organizations but need to be thought of as systemic challenges in which business, government and civil society each play different roles. Sustainability involves structural changes over longer periods of time, and requires co-evolutionary changes in technology, economy, culture and organizational forms. We propose that the transition management framework offers a fruitful way to analyze such co-evolutionary processes of social transformation and subsequently develop strategies to influence and accelerate such processes. We present the case of two firms working in this new context of transition management in The Netherlands. From these cases we conceptualize a more general approach for business to redefine and reframe the societal context in which it is operating and develop novel business strategies.

Experimental studies on a wide variety of mammals, including those with retrognathic postcanine teeth, predict that responses to masticatory loading will be greater in the occlusal plane, the inferior rostrum, and regions associated with the attachments of the temporalis and masseter muscles. Here we test these experimentally-derived predictions on an extinct human population from the middle and upper Ohio valley that underwent a marked shift from hunting-gathering to extensive farming during the last 3,000 years and for which we have good archaeological evidence about diet and food processing technology. Geometric morphometric methods were used to detect and measure the putative effect of diet changes on cranial shape independent of size. Our results partially confirm only some of the experimental predictions. The effect of softer and/or less tough diets on craniofacial shape seem to be concentrated in the relative reduction of the temporal fossa and in a displacement of the attachment of the temporal muscle. However, there were few differences in craniofacial shape in regions closer to the occlusal plane. These results highlight the utility of exploring specific localized morphological shifts using a hierarchical model of craniofacial integration. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric-morphometrics; Masticatory stress; Skull shape; Technological transition; Upper-middle Ohio valley","article; craniofacial morphology; food processing; lifestyle modification; mastication; species extinction; temporalis muscle; United States; Analysis of Variance; Bite Force; Cephalometry; Diet; Fossils; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Mastication; Ohio; Skull; Mammalia",,,,,,"Agrawal, K.R., Lucas, P.W., Prinz, J.F., Bruce, I.C., Mechanical properties of foods responsible for resisting food breakdown in the human mouth (1997) Arch Oral Biol, 42, pp. 1-9; Atchley, W.R., Hall, B.K., A model for development and evolution of complex morphological structures (1991) Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc, 66, pp. 101-157; Bastir, M., Rosas, A., Hierarchical nature of morphological integration and modularity in the human posterior face (2005) Am J Phys Anthropol, 128, pp. 26-34; Beecher, R.M., Corruccini, R.S., Effects of dietary consistency on maxillary arch breadth in macaques (1981) J Dent Res, 60, p. 68; Beecher, R.M., Corruccini, R.S., Freeman, M., Craniofacial correlates of dietary consistency in a nonhuman primate (1983) J Craniofac Genet Dev Biol, 3, pp. 193-202; Bellowd, P., First farmers: The origins of agricultural societies (2007) Cambridge Archaeol J, 17, pp. 87-109; Bender, M.M., Baerreis, D.A., Steventon, R.L., Further light on carbon isotopes and Hopewell agriculture (1981) Am Antiq, 46, pp. 346-353; Blanksma, N.G., van Eijden, T.M.G.J., Van Ruijven, L.J., Weijs, W.A., Electromyographic heterogeneity in the human temporalis and masseter muscles during dynamic tasks guided by visual feedback (1997) J Dental Res, 76, pp. 542-551; Brace, C.L., Rosenberg, K., Hunt, K.D., Gradual change in human tooth size in the late Pleistocene and post-Pleistocene (1987) Evolution, 41, pp. 705-720; Brace, C.L., Smith, S.L., Hunt, K.D., What big teeth you had grandma!

A distinction is drawn between simple and complex forms of clothing, with broad implications for the interpretation of paleolithic technological transitions and the emergence of modern human behavior. Physiological principles and paleoenvironmental data are harnessed to identify conditions requiring simple, loosely draped garments and the more challenging conditions that demanded additional protection in the form of complex garment assemblages. No actual clothing survives from the Pleistocene, yet the archaeological record yields evidence for technological and other correlates of clothing-more evidence than is generally supposed. Major innovations and trends in the distributions and relative frequencies of lithic and other tool forms may reflect the changing need for portable insulation in the context of fluctuating ice age climates. Moreover, the nonthermal repercussions of complex clothing can be connected with archaeological signatures of modern human behavior, notably adornment. Alternative models are less parsimonious in accounting for the geographical and temporal variability of prominent technological and other behavioral patterns in association with environmental change. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Climate; Clothing; Modern human behavior; Paleolithic technology",,,,,,,"Adovasio, J.M., Soffer, O., Klíma, B., Upper palaeolithic fibre technology: Interlaced woven finds from Pavlov I, Czech Republic, c. 26, 000 years ago (1996) Antiquity, 70, pp. 526-534; Aiello, L., Wheeler, P., Neanderthal thermoregulation and the glacial climate (2003) Neanderthals and Modern Humans in the European Landscape during the Last Glaciation: Archaeological Results of the Stage 3 Project, pp. 147-166. , T.

Sustainable development is used here as a common notion referring to those persistent problems in (Western industrialized) societies that can only be dealt with on the very long term (decades or more) through specific types of network and decision-making processes. Based on interdisciplinary research into complex processes of long term, structural change in society, basic tenets for complexity-based governance are formulated. These tenets are translated into a framework that distinguishes between four different types of governance activities and their respective roles in societal transitions. This framework can be used for implementation of governance strategies and instruments. The approach and framework have been developed deductively and inductively in the Netherlands since 2000. This article presents the theoretical basis of transition management and will be illustrated by examples from transition management practice, especially the Dutch national energy transition program. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,,"Ackoff, R.L., Towards a system of systems concepts (1971) Management Science, 17 (11), pp. 661-671; Allen, P.M., Knowledge, ignorance, and the evolution of complex systems (2001) Frontiers of Evolutionary Economics: Competition and Self-organization and Innovation Policy, , ed.

Box 5015, 2600 GA, Delft, Netherlands","Shaping energy transitions not only requires technical system innovation and redesign but also new policies, regulations, Research and Development (R&amp;D) and investment strategies - a transition assemblage. Transition management thus equates to designing and implementing such an assemblage. Agent-Based Models (ABMs) may be used for ex-ante assessment of transition assemblage alternatives. To help determine whether the design of a particular model is fit for its purpose, we have developed a typology. Three models were assessed: 1 a model on the impact of CO2 policy on the power production sector 2 a model on the transition of the global Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure 3 a model on the imminent transition caused by the arrival of Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lighting systems. All three models can be used to compare transition assemblage alternatives and could be adapted to assess regulatory adaptability.

The proposed model considers material preparation for outsourcing firms, technological transition, quality, lead time, and their interactions. The model also uses cost, quality and effectiveness as decision criteria for capacity planning and for determining product requirements for multi-stage planning of the make/outsourcing formulation. Different scenarios involving capacity transitions limited by technical factors, additions, and support shortages are mathematically formulated. In addition to its functions for evaluating cost minimisation and for accommodating the components of lead time, quality, and responsiveness, the proposed model also integrates multi-stage functions for supply chain systems. Therefore, the analytical results of this study, regardless of application outcomes or analysis methodology, provide decision criteria for manufacturing firms and introduce a new area of academic research.","Cost effectiveness; Integrated multi-stage model; Outsourcing; Vendor selection","Academic research; Analytical results; Capacity planning; Cost minimisation; Integrated multi-stage model; Leadtime; Linear programming models; Manufacturing firms; Material preparation; Multi-stage; Multi-stage models; Multi-stage planning; Product requirements; Supply chain systems; Technical factors; Technological transition; Vendor Selection; Chains; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Dynamic programming; Industrial research; Linearization; Outsourcing; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Cost benefit analysis",,,,,,"Abdel-Malek, L., Kullpattaranirun, T., Nanthavanij, S., A framework for comparing outsourcing strategies in multi-layered supply chain (2005) International Journal of Production Economics, 97 (3), pp. 318-328; Aissaoui, N., Haouari, M., Hassini, E., Supplier selection and order lot sizing modeling: A review (2007) Computer and Operations Research, 34 (12), pp. 3516-3540; Amid, A., Ghodsypour, S.H., O'Brien, C., Fuzzy multiobjective linear model for supplier selection in a supply chain (2006) International Journal of Production Economics, 104 (2), pp. 394-407; Araz, C., Ozfirat, P.M., Ozkarahan, I., An integrated multicriteria decision-making methodology for outsourcing management (2007) Computers and Operations Research, 34 (12), pp. 3738-3756; Bellman, R.E., Zadeh, L.A., Decision-making in a fuzzy environment (1970) Management Science, 17 (4), pp. 141-164; Bendor, P.S., Improving purchasing productivity at IBM with a normative decision support system (1985) Interfaces, 15 (3), pp. 106-115; Bhutta, K.S., Huq, F., Supplier selection problem: A comparison of the total costs of ownership and analytic al hierarchy process (2002) Supply Chain Management, 7 (3-4), pp. 126-135; Chalos, P., Costing, control, and strategic analysis in outsourcing decisions (1995) Journal of Cost Management, 8 (4), pp. 31-37; Chan, Y.C.L., Lynn, B.E., Performance evaluation and the analytic hierarchy process (1991) Journal of Management Accounting Research, Fall, pp. 57-87; Chapman, S.N., Just-in-time supplier inventory: An empirical implementation model (1989) International Journal of Production Research, 27 (12), pp. 1993-2007; Chaudhry, S.S., Forst, F.G., Zydiak, J.L., Vendor selection with price breaks (1993) European Journal of Operational Research, 70 (1), pp. 52-66; Chen, C.T., Lin, C.T., Huang, S.F., A fuzzy approach for supplier evaluation and selection in supply chain management (2006) International Journal of Production Economics, 102 (2), pp. 289-301; Chiampi, M., Ragusa, C., Repetto, M., Fuzzy approach for multiobjective optimization in magnetics (1996) IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 32 (3), pp. 1234-1237; Choy, K.L., Lee, W.B., Lo, V., An intelligent supplier management tool for benchmarking suppliers in outsourcing manufacturing (2002) Expert Systems with Applications, 22 (2), pp. 213-224; Company, A., Ronen, B., Production outsourcing: A linear programming model for the theory of constraints (2000) International Journal of Production Research, 38 (7), pp. 1631-1639; Davidrajuh, R., Modeling and implementation of supplier selection procedures for e-commerce initiatives (2003) Industrial Management and Data Systems, 103 (1), pp. 28-38; Deboer, L., Wegen, V.D., Telgen, L., Outranking methods in support of supplier selection (1998) European Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 4 (2-3), pp. 109-118; Degraeve, Z., Roodhooft, F., A mathematical programming approach for procurement using activity based costing (2000) Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 27 (1-2), pp. 69-98; Demirtas, E.A., Üstün, Ö., An integrated multiobjective decision making process for supplier selection and order allocation (2008) Omega: The International Journal of Management Science, 36 (1), pp. 76-90; Dulmin, R., Mininno, V., Supplier selection using a multi-criteria decision aid method (2003) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 9 (4), pp. 177-187; Ernst, R., Kamrad, B., Ord, K., Delivery performance in vendor selections (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 176 (1), pp. 534-541; Fisher, M.L., What is the right supply chain for your product?

Although Chinese government has always expressed wishes to achieve ""prosperity in common"", things have gone contrary to current statistical severe wealth polarization, which is the result of improper system transition path. Deepening the reform of income distribution system for rapid improvement of livelihood should be a key mission so that to increase income of urban and rural residents. Here, we analyzed the strong path-dependence of Chinese economic reform for state-own corporations, especially the distribution system. Further, we discussed many profound paradoxes in principle agency, property right boundary, distribution that exist in the public ownership economy. Based on these analyzes, we dissected the fundamental reasons of the climbing Gini coefficient in China and limitations in the solution proposed by the 17th CPC congress final report for solutions to balance income disparity based on principle-agent theory. We demonstrated that Chinese state owned corporations should not take it for granted that as long as the reform direction is right, reform objectives will be achieved by releasing contradictions. Instead, we propose that the essence of reform not only include short term effect, more importantly, should consider benefits in the long term. Otherwise, improper choice in original reform will tamper the long run goals. Finally, we proposed suggestions on solving current social, economical and political problems in China. ©2009 IEEE.","Distribution reforming; Economic development of China; Principle-agent; State owned corporation","Chinese economics; Chinese Government; Critical challenges; Distribution reforming; Distribution systems; Economic crisis; Economic development; Economical aspects; Gini coefficients; Income distribution; Long term; Political problems; Principle-agent theory; Property right; Public ownership; Rural residents; Short-term effects; System transitions; Management science; Polarization; Economics",,,,,,"Long, H., (2008) Strategies on how to improve management of state own capital[J], (20), p. 641. , Technology Information; Duan, W., Chen, G., Tan, Q., Dong, L., Institutional economics - Analysis on institution and economy[C] Nankai University Publishing Company, , ISBN 7-310-01945-8; Sang, B., Wang, J., Research on Chinese market economy theories[M], , UIBE Publishing Corporation.

A multi-level perspective on transitions to low carbon socio-technical regimes is introduced, and illustrated through the example of electricity supply. An associated 'transition management' (TM) approach, which considers policy measures to induce low carbon transitions, is then adopted as the central focus. A diagnosis of the climate challenge from a TM perspective is developed, and a range of familiar strategies for reducing emissions is considered in light thereof. Although political realities and dificulties have been given little emphasis in the TM literature, strategies with political implications are identifiable. These recommendations have technocratic overtones and assume a consensual or corporatist model of politics. A committed and explicitly political programme for transitions, rather than TM, may be necessary. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Climate policy; Socio-technical transitions; Transition management","emission control; environmental management; environmental policy; environmental politics; policy approach; strategic approach",,,,,,"Berkhout, F., Smith, A., Stirling, A., Socio-technical regimes and transition contexts (2004) System Innovation and the Transition to Sustainability, pp. 48-76. , In: B.

Sharing a similar understanding of sustainability transitions -namely as major transformational changes of system characteristics-and a background epistemology of complex systems, autopoeisis, and evolutionary mechanisms, they address the subject from different angles: one approach asks how transformative changes happen and what they look like, and the other approach tries answer the question of how to bring them about. The Viennese approach is almost exclusively analytical and deals with a macro (""landscape"") level of human history with a time scale of decades to centuries; the Dutch approach is based on intervention experiences and deals with a shorter time frame (decades) of micro-meso-macro levels of industrial societies. From both their respective angles, they contribute to some of the key questions of sustainability research, namely: how can a transformative change toward sustainability be distinguished from other types of social change? By which mechanisms can obstacles, path dependencies, and adverse interests be overcome? And what are the key persistent problems that call for such a transition?. © 2009 by the author(s).","Social metabolism; Sociometabolic regimes; Transition management","conceptual framework; integrated approach; observational method; social change; sustainability",,,,,,"Ayres, R.U., Kneese, A.V., Production, consumption and externalities (1969) American Economic Review, 59 (3), pp. 282-297; Avelino, F., (2007) Power In Transition, , http://www.ksinetwork.nl, [online] URL; Berkes, F., Folke, C., Linking social and ecological systems for resilience and sustainability (1998) Linking Social and Ecological Systems.

To analyze the database of cadastral data on land use of about 13,000 comparable basic territorial units (CTU) and their regional differentiation the typology method (the establishment of types of changes in CTUs and their portion of all CTUs) was used above all. At the same time tables follow the periods which formed over the long-term the preceding land use situation in Czechia at the start of the transition (1845-1948 and 1948-1990). Ascertained changes and trends in land use changes are then interpreted on the basis of searching out and explaining the main political, economic and social factors (or societal driving forces) that caused them. Their interaction with natural conditions is taken into account as well.","Czechia; Land use changes; Landscape development; Societal driving forces; Societal transition","cadastre; democratic transition; land use change; landscape change; mapping; market transition; capitalism; economic relations; political relations; Czech Republic",,,,,,"Bičík, I., Dynamic land use in the Czech Republic: Data sources, research methods and Compatibility (2002) Land Use Changes in Comparative Perspective, pp. 21-30. , Himiyama, Y., Hwang M., Ichinose, T.

In terms of the scholarly development of public administration in China, the roots of those intellectual resources can be traced far back, to Confucius's ideology of governance and the ancient development of a civil service system some 2,000 years ago. In terms of the systematic development of public administration as an independent subject of learning, however, the United States has been a leader worldwide. Public administration as a discipline in the United States dates back to the late nineteenth century, with extensive scholarly research and publications in the early twentieth century (Follett 1926; Goodnow 1900; Taylor 1912; Weber 1922; White 1926). In the Chinese context, although there were occasional studies of public administration in the first half of the twentieth century, systematic study was deferred until the middle of the 1980s. They were only truly continued following the official launch of master of public administration degree programs at the beginning of the twenty-first century. In this respect, China was a latecomer, and Chinese scholars almost always date the study and scholarship in this field to about 1980. Over the past eighty years or so, the United States has established more than 200 MPA and related programs, while China has founded 100 MPA programs in just the past eight years. Recognizing the urgent need for MPA training, China is trying to catch up to the demand for social development and societal transition. Considering that China has a population of 1.3 billion, compared to a population of 300 million in the United States, it looks as if there is great potential for China to expand its MPA programs. © 2009 The American Society for Public Administration.",,,,,,,,"Breul, J., Borrowing Experiences from Other Countries (1996) New Ideas, Better Government, , In. edited by.

This presumes a good understanding of the governance of the transition processes. The GoReNEST project was designed to contribute to this end. This Summary Report of the GoReNEST project presents an analytical MLP transition management framework to support the Nordic energy system transition, considers relevant Nordic energy research in the light of this framework and assesses the potential of this research in supporting the governance of energy system transition and related policy planning. An analysis of relevant governance and funding models is also presented, exploring the recent advances in R&D&I governance and funding models. The experiences of the GoReNEST project suggest that the awareness of the MLP transition management framework and its various elements should be enhanced, recognizing also the complementary roles of various research approaches in this respect. Better integration of energy system research and innovation research is also called for. Policy implications and needs for future research are also discussed, including recommendations for Nordic actors.

It is well documented that coal is not an environmentally friendly fuel, unless it is utilized in cooperation with clean coal technologies. This paper uses the Transition Management approach to devise a framework for the transition towards clean coal technologies in India. The concept of Transition Management is firmly rooted in the traditions of system thinking that highlights the co-evolution of the socio-technical systems. In order to make technological change sustainable, technical changes alone are not sufficient - changes in the social dimension - such as user practices, governance and institutions are necessary. The role of the government during the transition process is interactive policy formulation - lowering of legal, institutional and policy obstacles and facilitating knowledge transfer and collaboration between the actors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Technological analysis has permitted a reinterpretation of the so-called Mumba Industry, a transitional industry between Middle and Later Stone Ages originally defined by Mehlman (1989). Our data confirm Mehlman S observation that the ""evolutionary"" markers in Mumba Bed V are basically typological. However, our study differs from his in that we classify all of Bed V as LSA based on the combined analyses of typology and technology in our excavated assemblage. From a technological perspective, no changes have been observed throughout the sequence, and continuity is the main technological characteristic of the series. The only transitional marker from Lower through Upper Bed V is the appearance of the geometric crescent in the latter, taking into account that microliths exist throughout the sequence. This evidence casts some doubts on previous interpretations and underscores the need to recover a larger sample using modern excavation techniques. It also stresses the need to define the MSA/LSA transition in better terms, combining techno-typological criteria. © Africa Magna Verlag.","East Africa; Later Stone Age; Lithic technology; Middle Stone Age; Modern human behavior; Mumba rock-shelter; Technological transition",,,,,,,"Ambrose, S.H., Chronology of the Later Stone Age and food production in East Africa (1998) Journal of Archaeological Science, 25 (4), pp. 377-392; Ambrose, S.H., Small things remembered.

These are capital-intensive, long-lived large scale socio-technical systems that evolve over decades. To enable high-level decision support on climate policy, strategic investment decisions or transition management, we are evolving a simulation engine for Agent-Based simulation of infrastructure development. The key functionality and capability of this engine is its ability for playing out possible futures, to identify development patterns and conditions for sustainability by exploring multiple scenarios. Two of the models completed serve to illustrate the approach. These address the ecological impact of bio-electricity and the long-term effect of CO2 policy on the electricity production technology portfolio. Limits and opportunities of the approach are discussed and an outline for future research is given. ©2009 IEEE.","Agent based modeling; Complex systems; Evolution; Infrastructure","Agent based simulation; Agent-based modeling; Climate policy; Complex adaptive systems; Complex systems; Decision supports; Ecological impacts; Electricity production; Infrastructure development; Long-term effects; Model-based; Possible futures; Simulation engine; Sociotechnical systems; Strategic investments; Sustainable energy; Sustainable infrastructure; Theory and modeling; Transition management; Adaptive systems; Decision support systems; Energy conservation; Investments",,,,,,"U.

Many professionals are resigned to learning on the job, and walk into new roles partially blindfolded. This makes the learning curve steeper and more fraught than it needs to be. Learning some basic techniques to be incorporated on a personal level and to enable an individual to deal with issues in the new organisation can help them to cope with transition confidently. Devising a plan for the first 90 days focusing on key domains reduces the uncertainty of making a successful transition, and also makes a positive difference to the organisation. The goal of successful transition management is to achieve transitional acceleration, reach the breakeven point earlier and set the tone for further development in the years to come. © 2008 Radcliffe Publishing.","Career; Change; Responsibility; Skill; Transition","article; career mobility; career planning; decision making; human; leadership; learning; medical profession; organization and management; priority journal; professional competence; professional development; professionalism; quality of working life; self concept",,,,,,"Chantler, C., The role and education of doctors in the delivery of health care (1999) Lancet, 353, pp. 1178-1181; Dean, A., Mentors for newly appointed consultants (2003) Advances in Psychiatric Treatment, 9, pp. 164-165; (1983) NHS Management Inquiry (Griffiths Report), , Department of Health and Social Security.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on extensive discussions with and informal surveys of executives. Findings: General management responsibilities differ greatly from functional responsibilities, both in degree and in kind. The gap is larger than most executives anticipate. The big surprises are not always those that they expected. The way companies prepare executives for general management can generate problems of its own. Practical implications: GMs need a guidance system for diagnosing where to spend their time and a system for exerting influence - and the paper provides a template. Originality/value: The paper identifies the ways in which the move into general management presents a massive increase in the complexity of responsibilities for executives and why it is so challenging for many. The framework helps GMs anticipate and master the challenge of general management - and helps them prepare and develop their own subordinates for a similar move. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","General management; Leadership; Management development; Transition management",,,,,,,"(2008) Leading In the Top Team: The Cxo Challenge, , Bottger, P.C., (ed.), Cambridge University Press; Barsoux, J.L., Bottger, P.C., The offline imperative (2007) Strategy & Leadership, 35 (3), pp. 50-54; Bottger, P.C., (2009) The Leader's Tool-kit: The 'Big 5' to Ensure High-quality Results, , A model that synthesizes several of these approaches was introduced in, working paper, IMD; Gilbert, X., Developing competitive advantage (1991) The Strategy Process, , An excellent exposition of competitive advantage is to be found in, in Mintzberg, H. and Quinn, J.B.

Using a two-step approach the abstract concepts are linked to the realm of the policy maker. First the forces underlying transitions are identified and second where they can be found is presented. For this a conceptual map of societal systems, the clover model, is introduced. With the clover model the structures, cultures and practices of societal systems can be found. Furthermore, intermediate changes are systematically treated to track the phases of a transition. These transition diagnostics are supplemented with recommended policy frameworks. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, considering the local origins of transition management, it is also valid to question whether its assumptions concerning the governance of long-term transitions 'travel well'. This article aims to explore early experiences of transferring the transition management model into the Finnish context on the basis of two case studies in different sectors.

At one extreme, democracy can be framed as problematic for policy planning because of the myopia fostered by some democratic institutions, such as regular elections. Alternatively, democracy can be seen as an ally of long-term policy design to the extent that it can generate public legitimacy and accountability, and potentially foster more equitable and just outcomes. Recent debates on how to 'manage' policy transitions to sustainability have been curiously silent on democratic matters, despite their potential implications for democracy. To explore what democracy might mean for transition management this article considers empirically how actors engaged in the Dutch Energy Transition Program make democratic sense of their activities. The analysis finds that in practice transition policies promote implicit narratives or democratic storylines on how reforms should be developed, who should participate in these, and how they should be legitimised and accountable to the public. The dominant narrative, which espouses elite theory and technocracy, privileges epistemic matters over democratic considerations. Other democratic storylines draw on representative democracy and interest group pluralism. The paper considers some possible ways to foster more productive interfaces between the governance structures of transition management, and the polycentric context of contemporary democratic systems. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Accountability; Democracy; Energy; Legitimacy; Long-term policy design; Network governance; Participation; Representative; Sustainability; Transition management","accountability; democracy; governance approach; local participation; management practice; policy making; policy reform; sustainability",,,,,,"Aars, J., Fimreite, A.L., Local government and governance in Norway: Stretched accountability in network politics (2005) Scandinavian Political Studies, 28 (3), pp. 239-256. , DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2005.00131.x; Argyris, C., Putnam, R., McLain Smith, D., (1985) Action Science, Concepts, Methods, and Skills for Research and Intervention, , Jossey-Bass San Francisco; Auel, K., Multi-level governance, regional policy, and democratic legitimacy in Germany (2006) Governance and Democracy, pp. 44-62. , A.

What is being proposed is the replacement of specific elements of existing policy 'mixes'-the goals and means-by others, in the expectation of avoiding counterproductive or sub-optimal policy outcomes. While laudable, such efforts are fraught with risks; including the possibility of the creation of sub-optimal policy mixes or of failed reform efforts with resulting poor outcomes. This article develops a model and typology of policy regime change processes and outcomes following Thelen and others in arguing that complex policy mixes typically emerge through one or more of four processes, 'drift', 'conversion', 'layering' and 'replacement', and that the expected outcomes of these different processes in terms of their ability to meet initial expectations are linked to the manner in which policy goals and means are (or are not) combined in a consistent, coherent and congruent fashion. This propensity is illustrated through examination of the case of energy transition management as practiced in the Netherlands. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Energy policy; Netherlands; Policy mixes; Public policy; Sustainability; Transition management","energy policy; management practice; policy implementation; policy reform; sustainability; typology; Netherlands",,,,,,"Agterbosch, S., Vermeulen, W., Glasbergen, P., Implementation of wind energy in the Netherlands: The importance of the social-institutional setting (2004) Energy Policy, 32 (18), pp. 2049-2066. , DOI 10.1016/S0301-4215(03)00180-0, PII S0301421503001800; Aubert, P.J., (2007) Energy Transition-The Dutch Approach, , KSI Winterschool 2007 Vught; Bardach, E., (1977) The Implementation Game: What Happens after A Bill Becomes A Law, , MIT Press Cambridge, MA; Beland, D., Ideas and institutional change in social security: Conversion, layering and policy drift (2007) Social Science Quarterly, 88 (1), pp. 20-38. , 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2007.00444.x; Bovens, M., 'T Hart, P., (1996) Understanding Policy Fiascoes, , Transaction Press New Brunswick, NJ; Braybrooke, D., Lindblom, C.E., (1963) A Strategy of Decision.

The current revival tries to avoid the pitfalls of an earlier generation of positivistic long-range planning and control approaches. Instead, this new generation of policy design emphasises reflexive governance concepts. These aim at inducing and navigating complex processes of socio-technical change by means of deliberation, probing and learning. A practical expression of this move that is attracting growing international attention amongst researchers and practitioners is the policy of 'Transition Management' (TM) in the Netherlands. This article takes stock of TM implementation experience to date and discusses the critical issues it raises for long-term policy design. The article provides a framework and synthesis for this Special Issue, which comprises articles that address a range of those issues in more depth. We highlight three critical issues: the politics of societal learning, contextual embedding of policy design and dynamics of the design process itself. This leads us to propose a view on policy design as a contested process of social innovation. Our conclusion considers implications for continued work on designing transition management in practice as well as the reflexive capacities of democratic politics. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Deliberation; Innovation in governance; Long-term planning; Policy design; Politics of learning; Reflexive governance; Socio-technical change; Sustainable development; Transition management","conceptual framework; governance approach; innovation; learning; management practice; policy approach; policy implementation; policy reform; sustainable development; Netherlands",,,,,,"Arts, B., Van Tatenhove, J., Policy and power: A conceptual framework between the ""old"" and ""new"" policy idioms (2005) Policy Sciences, 37 (34), pp. 339-356; Avelino, F., Empowerment and the challenge of applying transition management to ongoing projects (2009) Policy Sciences, 42 (4), pp. 369-390; Bardach, E., (1977) The Implementation Game: What Happens after A Bill Becomes A Law, , MIT Press Cambridge, MA; Beck, U., The reinvention of politics: Towards a theory of reflexive modernization (1994) Reflexive Modernization, pp. 1-55. , U.

More specifically, it studies the empowerment aspect of a specific long-term policy design, transition management (TM), both theoretically and empirically. First, the respective bodies of literature on empowerment and TM are synthesized and four theoretically (dis)empowering aspect of TM are discussed. On that basis, four research questions are distilled as a framework for empirical analysis. Second, an empirical account is given of challenges that came up during the application of TM in ongoing projects, and these challenges are analyzed in terms of (dis)empowerment, following a critical line of argument. Third, a more instrumental line of argument distils lessons for TM, by applying empowering insights to design strategies on how to deal with the upcoming challenges of TM. The challenges, analyses, and lessons are summarized in a table at the end. In conclusion, the theoretical and empirical findings are related to a discussion on long-term policy design more generally.","Empowerment; Long-term policy design; Participation; Sustainable transport; Transition management","conceptual framework; empirical analysis; empowerment; local participation; management practice; policy making; policy reform; sustainability",,,,,,"Argyris, C., Empowerment: The emperor's new clothes (1998) Harvard Business Review, 76 (3), pp. 98-105; Avelino, F., Bressers, N., Short versus long-term and other dichotomies: A challenge for transition management (2008) Conference Paper Presented at the NECTAR Workshop 'Transition Towards Sustainable Mobility: The Role of Instruments, Individuals and Institutions', Erasmus University of Rotterdam, , May 15-16, 2008; Boje, D.M., Rosile, G.A., Where is the power in empowerment?

We describe the interactions that occurred in a project for the fourth National Environmental Policy Plan in the Netherlands. The project was successful in that it produced a new concept and set of principles for policy to deal with persistent problems such as global climate change, which were used in the national policy plan. The new concept was that of transition and the principles were: policy integration, long-term thinking for short-term action, keeping multiple options open and learning-by-doing and doing-by-learning. Retrospectively, we ask ourselves: what factors facilitated the acceptance of the first ideas about transition management? Reconstructing the events and drawing on interviews with key individuals involved, we have tried to find the key factors for the adoption of the ideas developed in the project. Finally, we reflect upon our role as scientists-advisors and the role of others in the development of a new story line and set of principles for policy. Our own assessment, 8 years later, is that we were engaged in boundary work. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Boundary work; Science-policy coproduction; Transition management","conceptual framework; energy policy; innovation; management practice; policy making; policy reform; strategic approach; Netherlands",,,,,,"Caplan, N., The two communities theory and knowledge utilization (1979) American Behavioral Scientist, 22, pp. 459-470. , 10.1177/000276427902200308; Eriksson, J., Sundelius, B., Molding minds that form policy: How to make research useful (2005) International Studies Perspectives, 6 (1), pp. 51-71. , DOI 10.1111/j.1528-3577.2005.00193.x; Geels, F., Kemp, R., Transities vanuit sociotechnisch perspectief, achtergrondrapport voor de studie (2000) Transities en Transitiemanagement, , van ICIS en MERIT ten behoeve van NMP-4.

The social transformations in China, Russia, and the other European former socialist countries since 1989, however, have challenged both the traditional approaches of Sociology of Development with a series of new issues: how should one evaluate the various pathways to development in different countries and regions? how should one examine the state-society relationship in social development and transition? how can one deal with the social inequality in the process of development? These topics have expanded the scope of the Sociology of Development and provided an opportunity to construct new theories. I suggest that, in response to the practice conditions of ongoing socioeconomic transformation, new theories of transition, in addition to theories of modernization and theories of development, is the imperative need in the field of the sociology of development.","Modernization theories; Societal transition; Sociology of development; Theories of transition",,,,,,,"Amin, S., (1976) Unequal Development: An Essay On the Social Formation of Peripheral Capitalism, , New York: Monthly Review Press; Arendt, H., (1951) 1993. the Origins of Totalitarianism (Jiquan Zhuyi), , translated by Cai Yingwen.

The model uses the concepts of transition theory as a framework for assessing possible pathways by which a transition to a sustainable mobility society might happen. The modelling approach combines agent-based modelling techniques with a system dynamics structure. It is original in that there are two levels of agent. There are a small number of complex agents, which have an internal structure and are therefore subsystems within society, and a larger number of simple agents. Based on the UK data, the results show that Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs) come to dominate, but only in the very long run (after 2030), while biofuels and ICE (Internal Combustion Engine)-electric hybrids are the main alternatives to the regime in the next 10-30 years, because a) they are already developed and b) they fit better into current infrastructures. The model shows that technological transitions are most likely. Lifestyle change transitions require sustained pressure from the environment on society and behavioural change from consumers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

With regard to this transition, the article addresses a new direction, namely the role of foundational ontologies in explanation. Five ontologies are distinguished, which are based on different assumptions about causal agents and causal mechanisms: rational choice, functionalism, conflict and power struggle, interpretivism, and structuralism. The article demonstrates how these ontologies provide different explanations of same case. It also empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of different ontological explanations, and identifies possible complementarities in this case. The article ends with theoretical reflections on the relationships between ontologies and the role of meta-paradigm analysis. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Agribusiness; Crossovers; Foundational ontologies; Multi-disciplinarity; Pig farming; Transitions","agroindustry; animal husbandry; complementarity; interdisciplinary approach; livestock farming; meta-analysis; mixed farming; paradigm shift; theoretical study; Netherlands; Suidae",,,,,,"Agricultural statistics 1972 (1972), Agricultural Economics Research Institute (AERI)., Wageningen: AERIAllison, G.T., (1971) Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis, , Boston, MA: Little Brown; Bieleman, J., History of Dutch agriculture, 1500-1950: Changes and diversity (1992), Amsterdam en Meppel: BoomBijker, W.E., (1995) Of Bicycles, Bakelites and Bulbs: Towards a Theory of Sociotechnical Change, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Boyd, W., Making meat: Science, technology, and American poultry production (2001) Technology and Culture, 42 (4), pp. 631-664; Burger, T., Multidimensional problems: A critique of Jeffrey Alexander's theoretical logic in sociology (1986) The Sociological Quarterly, 27 (2), pp. 273-292; Crijns, A.H., From adjustment to revolution in Brabant agriculture and horticulture, 1950-1985: Scale increase and specialisation (1998), Tilburg: Stichting Zuidelijk Historisch Contact Tilburgde Groot, M.N., Bauwens, A.L.G.M., Fifty years of Dutch agricultural policy: Consensus and conflict (1990) Agrarisch Bestaan: Beschouwingen Bij Vijftig Jaar Landbouw-economisch Instituut, pp. 146-169. , ed.

The development of this body of work may be seen as a response to the complexities, uncertainties and problems which confront many western societies, in organising 'sustainably' various aspects of energy, agricultural, water, transport and health systems of production and consumption; problems which are seen as systemic and entwined or embedded in a series of social, economic, political, cultural and technological relationships. For all the light that transitions approaches shine on such processes they say little explicitly about the role of places. In this paper we address this through looking at the way in which London is currently beginning to shape a systemic transition in its energy infrastructure. We outline and discuss key aspects of the roles of strategic intermediary organisations, which have been strategically set up to intervene between technological possibilities and the territorial context of London. We draw on the case of London to highlight an emblematic example of a city's attempt to systemically re-shape its energy infrastructure and the lessons to be drawn from this. We also outline the particularity of London in this respect, the limitations of the transferability of experiences in London and highlight directions for future research in this area.","Cities; Intermediary organisations; Transitions; Visions","complexity; perception; strategic approach; technological change; uncertainty role; England; Eurasia; Europe; London [England]; United Kingdom; Western Europe",,,,,,"Aglietta, M., (1979) A Theory of Capitalist Regulation: The US Experience, , Verso, London; Amin, A., Thrift, N., (2002) Cities: Re-imagining the Urban, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Berkhout, F., Smith, A., Stirling, A., (2003) Socio-technological Regimes and Transition Contexts; Brenner, N., Globalisation and reterritorialisation: The re-scaling of urban governance in the European Union (1999) Urban Studies, 36 (3), pp. 431-451; Bulkeley, H., Betsill, M., Rethinking sustainable cities: Multilevel governance and the 'urban' politics of climate change (2005) Environmental Politics, 14, pp. 42-63; Eames, M., McDowall, W., Hodson, M., Marvin, S., Negotiating generic and place-specific expectations of the hydrogen economy (2006) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 18 (3), pp. 361-374; European Commission Clean Urban Transport for Europe General Introduction Brochure, , European Commission, Brussels; (2003) Hydrogen Energy and Fuel Cells: A Vision of Our Future, , European Commission European Commission, Brussels; Fuller, C., Bennett, R., Ramsden, M., Local government and the changing institutional landscape of economic development in England and Wales (2004) Environment and Planning C, 22, pp. 317-347; Geels, F., Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: A multi-level perspective and a case study (2002) Research Policy, 31, pp. 1257-1274; Geels, F., Towards sociotechnical scenarios and reflexive anticipation: Using patterns and regularities in technology dynamics (2002) Shaping Technology, Guiding Policy: Concepts, Spaces and Tools, pp. 359-387. , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Geels, F., From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems.

The concept is based on two interrelated influencing factors. The first is the sectoral-specific transformative capacity of new technologies themselves, that is, their substantial or incremental impact on socioeconomic and institutional change in a given sectoral system. The second is the sectoral adaptability of socioeconomic structures, institutions, and actors confronted with the opportunities presented by new technologies. The first factor-the sectoral transformative capacity of new technologies-enables us to identify the technology-based pressure to change and adjust the structural, institutional, and organizational architectures of the sectoral system. The second, complementary factor-sectoral adaptability-helps us to discern the distinct social patterns of anticipating and adopting this technology-based pressure. The specific interplay between the two influencing factors creates distinguishable modes of sectoral transformation, ranging from anticipative and smooth adjustments to reactive and crisis-ridden patterns of change. Even processes of radical sectoral change continue over longer periods of mismatch and are characterized by numerous and mostly gradual organizational, structural and institutional transformations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To successfully navigate a technological transition, firms often face the ambidextrous challenge of ""exploiting"" existing complementary assets to support the new ""exploratory"" core technology. We argue that an industry incumbent attempting to make a transition to a new technology requires linkages between organizational units responsible for developing the new technology and units in charge of complementary assets needed to commercialize the innovation. These linkages are critical but overlooked elements of organizational ambidexterity. This paper develops a conceptual framework in which the ability to build and leverage organizational linkages involving the new technology and its complementary assets is essential for a successful technological transition. The framework also highlights the importance of middle management in creating and maintaining these linkages, which are critical to dynamic capabilities in technological transitions. We identify four critical influences-economic, structural, social, and cognitive-on managerial linking activity that enable firms to transition to a new technology while utilizing valuable preexisting capabilities. The technological transitions of IBM and NCR illustrate the importance of organizational linkages and managerial linking activity. © 2009 Informs.","Ambidexterity; Cognition; Complementary assets; Exploration and exploitation; Innovation",,,,,,,"Abernathy, W.J., Utterback, J., Patterns of industrial innovation (1978) Tech.

In this paper we analyse two recent frameworks, adaptive management and transition management, outlining what they could learn from each other. Though usually applied in different domains, the two conceptual frameworks aim to integrate bottom-up and top-down approaches, and share a focus on the ability of systems to learn and develop adaptive capacity whilst facing external shocks and long-term pressures. Both also emphasize learning from experimentation in complex systems, but transition management focuses more on the ability to steer long-term changes in system functions, whilst adaptive management emphasizes the maintenance of system functions in the face of external change. The combination of iterative learning and stakeholder participation from adaptive management has the potential to incorporate vital feedbacks into transition management, which in turn offers a longer-term perspective from which to learn about and manage socio-technical and social-ecological change. It is argued that by combining insights from both frameworks it may be possible to foster more robust and resilient governance of social-ecological systems than could be achieved by either approach alone. The paper concludes by critically reflecting upon the challenges and benefits of combining elements of each approach, as has been attempted in the methodology of a research project investigating social-ecological change in UK uplands.

Three contexts of frontier and their rapidly changing nature form the basis of the analysis. Agricultural frontiers (typically between farmland and forest) are defined by new relations of production and interplays between conservation, shifting modes of agriculture and natural resource use and management. Peri-urban frontiers (between countryside and city) are taken beyond their desakota/ chaan-meuang locations to a more generic interplay between urbanity and rurality in defining livelihood and identity.

The paper also seeks to consider the shift from social destruction (everyone fighting with one an other) to social collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: The focus of the paper is on the scope of the simultaneously functioning political, social and moral extremes. They are seen as the key attributes of chaotic social transition and as material for creating cooperative links. Findings: Political and social transformation running simultaneously, and followed by legal and administrativemodernization, provoked formerly unknown social conflicts in the transitional society. The case of Lithuania shows that the old methods for dealing with new conflicts were not suitable. Society became fragmented. Social costs of disintegration were high but not equal, when compared internationally. Interdependence between functionality, innovative and cultural potential of the state, and its capability to regulate conflicts and social controversies had been brought into political debates and public discussions after transition had been in progress for several years. This was a signal that political parties and the most influential social players became concerned about social outcomes of the reforms. Developing a newlegal and institutional environment, empowering cooperation and conflictmanagement in social interactions, is perceived as an indicator of the progress of the continuing transition. Research limitations/implications: Because of its nature and size, the research does not develop insights into the processes which were in some sense dependent on, and simultaneously became incentives for, the culture of cooperation in society; for example, dynamics of cooperation and competition among authorities and citizens, business and politics. Originality/value: Though great interest is shown in transitional processes in social and humanitarian studies, the rise of conflicts in society as well as the limitations of constructive ways of dealing with such conflicts are not yet the focus of social investigation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Lithuania; National economy; Political systems; Social capital; Social change; Transition management",,,,,,,"Adamkus, V., (2001) Trys Metiniai Pranešimai, , Baltos lankos, Vilnius; Adamus-Matuszynska, A., (1998) Współczesne teorie konfliktu społecznego, , Akademia Ekonomiczna im, K.

Such transitions are best perceived as involving multiple transition steps along a transition path. Due to the path dependent and irreversible nature of innovation in complex technologies, an initial transition step along some preferred path may cut off paths that later may turn out to be more desirable. For these reasons, initial transition steps should allow for future flexibility, where we define flexibility as robustness regarding changing evidence and changing preferences. We propose a technology assessment methodology based on rugged fitness landscapes, which identifies the flexibility of initial transition steps in complex technologies.

Design/methodology/approach: ""Policy ethnography"" may be used to examine the emergence of policy rationalities that may or may not be locally feasible. Through the use of a conceptual heuristics to interpret practice, this paper contrasts approaches in the development of ""conservative"" transition rationalities suited to the shift from plan to market whilst retaining a ruling Communist Party in power. Comparison is made between Vietnam, where a successful ""conservative"" transition occurred, and a failed policy experiment in the Soviet Union. The discussion extends to China, where, as in the case of Vietnam, a policy-oriented policy rationality of transition may be observed. Findings: Through the use of a conceptual heuristics to interpret practice this paper, contrasts approaches in the development of ""conservative"" transition rationalities suited to the shift from plan to market whilst retaining a ruling Communist Party in power.

Research limitations/implications: Further research into the development of conservative policy rationalities in other context is advised. Practical implications: The paper concludes that attaining a successful heuristics amongst policy consumers is likely a necessary condition of a managed conservative transition, and that this heuristics does well to define system changes as a process, rather than a discrete step, in constructing a cognitive basis for policy rationality.

Though some authors argue that these challenges can be overcome by firms possessing what have been called dynamic capabilities, little work has described in detail the critical resources that these capabilities leverage or the processes through which these resources accumulate and evolve. This paper explores these issues through an in-depth exploratory case study of one firm that has demonstrated consistently strong performance in an industry that is highly dynamic and uncertain. The focus for the present study is Microsoft, the leading firm in the software industry. The focus on Microsoft is motivated by providing evidence that the firm's product performance has been consistently strong over a period of time in which there have been several major technological transitions - one indicator that a firm possesses dynamic capabilities. This argument is supported by showing that Microsoft's performance when developing new products in response to one of these transitions - the growth of the World Wide Web - was superior to a sample of both incumbents and new entrants. Qualitative data are presented on the roots of Microsoft's dynamic capabilities, focusing on the way that the firm develops, stores, and evolves its intellectual property. Specifically, Microsoft codifies knowledge in the form of software ""components,"" which can be leveraged across multiple product lines over time and accessed by firms developing complementary products. The present paper argues that the process of componentization, the component ""libraries"" that result, the architectural frameworks that define how these components interact, and the processes through which these components are evolved to address environmental changes represent critical resources that enable the firm to respond to major technological transitions. These arguments are illustrated by describing Microsoft's response to two major technological transitions. © 2009 Product Development & Management Association.",,"Architectural frameworks; Complementary products; Critical resources; Dynamic capabilities; Environmental changes; Microsoft; Multiple products; New products; Product performance; Qualitative datum; Software industries; Technological transitions; Intellectual property; World Wide Web; Knowledge management",,,,,,"The Software Industry (1996) Economist, 339 (7967), p. 9. , Anonymous.

In the past 10 years, evolutionary policy approaches have been increasingly advocated. For several reasons, they seem well equipped to underpin sustainable innovation policies. They focus on dynamics of change and their drivers, they allow for a substantive perspective on technologies beyond mere input-output relations, taking into account trajectories and different characteristics of innovation, and they are able to describe circumstances under which established technologies might persist even when they are to some extent inferior to their new competitors (lock-in). However, the policy effectiveness of evolutionary approaches in cases in which radical or systemic changes are involved is not yet proven. In this paper we assess the theoretical rationale, instrumental aspects and the coping with policy constraints of three evolutionary policy approaches which have also been used in empirical studies: strategic niche management, transition management and time strategies. Each approach has its strengths and specific problems and all three have to be further developed and tested out but they hold promise for contributing to non-incremental change with economic and environmental benefits, by shaping processes of variation, selection and retention, with the outcomes feeding back into policy. They may also be used in other areas in which innovation direction is important, for instance health care or food. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Especially the key activities that are important for the build up of an innovation system receive much attention. These are labelled 'functions of innovation systems'. This paper builds on five empirical studies, related to renewable energy technologies, to test whether the functions of innovation systems framework is a valid framework to analyse processes of technological change. We test the claim that a specific set of functions is suitable. We also test the claim made in previous publications that the interactions between system functions accelerate innovation system emergence and growth. Both claims are confirmed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The principal contribution of this article is to articulate the relationship between transition management and complex systems theory. A better understanding of the dynamics of complex, adaptive systems provides insight into the opportunities, limitations, and conditions under which it is possible to influence such systems. Transition management is based on key notions of complex systems theory, such as variation and selection, emergence, coevolution, and self-organization. It involves a cyclical process of phases at various scale levels: stimulating niche development at the micro level, finding new attractors at the macro level by developing a sustainability vision, creating diversity by setting out experiments, and selecting successful experiments that can be scaled up. © 2009 by Yale University.","Complex adaptive systems; Emergence; Governance; Industrial ecology; Sustainable development; Transitions","Complex adaptive systems; Emergence; Governance; Industrial ecology; Transitions; Adaptive systems; Ecology; Large scale systems; Strategic planning; System theory; Sustainable development; complexity; governance approach; sustainable development",,,,,,"Allenby, B., (1999) Industrial ecology: Policy framework and implementation, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Arthur, W.B., Durlauf, S.N., Lane, D.A., (1997) The economy as an evolving complex system, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Avelino, F., Rotmans, J., Power in transition (2007) Submitted for publication to European Journal of Social Theory; Ayres, R.U., Ayres, L., (1996) Industrial ecology - towards closing the materials cycle, , Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar; Braungart, M., McDonough, W., (2002) Cradle to cradle: Remaking the way we make things, , NewYork: North Point Press; De Haan, J., How emergence arises (2006) Ecological Complexity, 3 (4), pp. 293-301; De Haan, J., Rotmans, J., Patterns in transitions (2008) Submitted for publication to Research Policy; De Vries, J., Riele, H.T., Playing with hyenas: Renovating environmental product policy strategy (2006) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 10 (3), pp. 111-127; Dirven, J., Rotmans, J., Verkaik, A.P., (2002) Samenleving in transitie: Een vernieuwend gezichtspunt, , Society in transition: A new viewpoint, The Hague, the Netherlands: Innovatienetwerk Agrocluster en Groene Ruimte; Ehrenfeld, J., Industrial ecology: A framework for product and process design (1997) Journal of Cleaner Production, 5 (1-2), pp. 87-96; Ehrenfeld, J., Gertler, N., Industrial ecology in practice: The evolution of interdependence at Kalundborg (1997) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 1 (1), pp. 67-80; Geels, F.W., (2005) Technological transitions and system innovations: A co-evolutionary and socio-technical analysis, , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Geldof, G., (2002) Omgaan met complexiteit bij integraal waterbeheer, , Dealing with complexity in integrated water management, Twente, the Netherlands: Universiteit Twente; Goldstein, J., Emergence as a construct: History and issues (1999) Emergence, 1 (1), pp. 49-72; Green, D.G., Evolution in complex systems (1994) Complex systems: Mechanism of adaptation, , edited by R.

APC's main goal is to isolate operating units from process disturbances by identifying the disturbances and determine its breadth of influence. APC performance can be tracked by calculating, historizing, and displaying a variable that indicates quality of control. These solutions are supposed to make greater use of inferred properties, and will be based on the physics and chemistry of the process.

Surprisingly, the interregnum between successive generations has received little attention. To understand what happens in the interregnum, we study the transition from 2G to 3G in mobile communications. Our study identifies the presence of forces for both change and continuity across heterogeneous social and technical elements shaping an uneven transition between 2G and 3G mobile communications technology platforms. Unanticipated misalignments and asynchronies that emerged during the journey shifted the incentives of the various actors involved to participate. Based on these observations, we offer several conjectures as to the dynamics that can give rise to temporal discords during inter-generational technological transitions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Planning and conservation laws, subsidies and the development of common law in the UK and the EU also provide evidence of this societal transition, but also of a conceptual shortfall in what precisely constitutes socially beneficial uses of land. A pragmatic, transparent yet robust framework is required to guide more equitable and sustainable decisionmaking in statute and common law, subsidy systems and public policy. Such a model of the relative private and pubic benefits derived from different land uses is developed using a risk-based approach founded on ecosystem services, validated using analysis of real land use practices. The model proved to be a helpful basis for orienting different types of land use against a grid of private and public benefits, serving as a semi-quantitative decision-support tool providing a comprehensive and transparent basis for discussion, stakeholder dialogue and the innovation of optimally beneficial uses of land. It also helped to identify changes in land use that can deliver greater public benefit, promoting participative decisionmaking and the testing of options through a simple, graphical interface. Development of this model is informed by, and in turn has informed, consideration of environmental and human development practices in South Africa, but it may also help inform better-integrated solutions for priority environmental management challenges such as the EU Water Framework Directive, opportunities for 'paying for ecosystem services' markets and improved targeting of subsidies under the EU Common Agricultural Policy.",,"agricultural policy; conservation planning; decision making; environmental legislation; European Union; graphical method; human development index; land use; landowner; law enforcement; private sector; public service; stakeholder; sustainable development; Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",,,,,,"The authors would like to acknowledge staff at DWAF KZN (the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, KwaZulu-Natal provincial office) participating in the UK Government-sponsored 'Watercourse' development programme, and the citizens of the Mvoti catchment (KZN) who engaged in an action research processes aimed at developing practical, integrated approaches to catchment management in KZN, The efforts of these people, and the processes that we have co-created, have been a primary impetus in the development of this articleEverard, M., Appleby, T., Safeguarding the societal value of land (2009) Environmental Law & Management, 21, pp. 16-23; (2007) Beyond the Pillars: Wildlife and Countryside Link's Policy Perspective on the Future of the CAP, , http://www.wcl.org.uk, Countryside Link; Pretty, J., Brett, C., Gee, D., An assessment of the external costs of UK agriculture (2000) Agricultural Systems, 65 (2), pp. 113-136; Everard, M., Appleby, T., Ecosystem services and the common law: Evaluating the full scale of damages (2008) Environmental Law and Management, 20, pp. 325-339; (2005) Ecosystems & Human Well-being: Synthesis, , Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, (Island Press Washington DC); M Everard, T Appleby (n 5)Turner, R.K., Georgiou, S., Fisher, B., (2008) Valuing Ecosystem Services: The Case of Multi-functional Wetlands (Earthscan); Stirling, A., Gee, D., Science precaution and practice (2003) Public Health Reports, 117 (6), pp. 521-533; Everard, M., Ecosystem services case studies (2009) Environment Agency Science Report SCHO0409 BPVM-E-E; M Everard, T Appleby (n 2)Defra, (2007) Securing A Healthy Natural Environment: An Action Plan for Embedding An Ecosystems Approach, , http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/natural-environ/ ecoactionplan.htm, London; Everard, M., (2009) The Business of Biodiversity, , WIT Press Ashurst; http://www.ensisjv.com/NewsEventsandPublications/Researchlnformation/ SocialandEnvironmentalEffectsofForestry/tabid/237/Default.aspxhttp://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/assessment/FILES/proceedings/PongoloCaseStudy. pdfhttp://www.wwt.org.uk/centre/122/slimbridge.htmlhttp://www.dwaf.gov.za/Documents/Other/CMA/Mvoti/SA-AppendixA-Mvoti.doc(2007) Payment for Ecosystem Services: Developing An Ecosystem Services Trading Model for the Mnweni/Cathedral Peak and Eastern Cape Drakensberg Areas, , Maloti Drakensberg Transfrontier Project, M Mander (ed) INR Report IR281, Development Bank of Southern Africa, Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, Department of Environment Affairs and Tourism, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, South Africa; http://www.alkboroughandwalcot.co.uk/index-files/Page2428.htmM Everard (n 10)McGrath, M., Crawshaw, D., United Utilities Sustainable Catchment Management Programme (SCaMP) (2008) Environmental Scientist, pp. 21-23. , October; M Everard (n 10)M Everard, T Appleby (n 2)http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/environment/cogap/M Everard (n 13)Defra, (2002) Growing Short Rotation Coppice: Best Practice Guidelines for Applicants to Defra's Energy Crops Scheme, , http://www.defra.gov.uk/ERDP/pdfs/ecs/src-guide.pdf; Chambers, R., (2008) Revolutions in Development Inquiry, pp. 105-150. , For diverse examples (Earthscan London); M Everard, T Appleby (n 2)http://www.unece.org/env/pp/, The UNECE Aarhus Convention: Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental MattersMander, M., Everard, M., The socio-economics of river management (2008) Environmental Scientist, pp. 31-34. , October; M Everard (n 13)","Everard, M.; Faculty of Environment and Technology, University of the West of England",,,,,,,,10676058,,ELAME,,,"English","Environmental Law and Management",Article,Scopus

Search and relational strategies oriented toward exploration versus exploitation have prevailed in different phases of the network evolution.

Its most important feature is its highly efficient use of processor resources, accomplished by dynamically changing the number of processors within a security-domain (i.e., dynamically yielding processors to other security-domains) in response to application load requirements. Two new technologies make this scaling possible without any virtualization software: (1) self-transition management and (2) unified virtual address mapping. Evaluations show that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs almost no performance overhead in security-domains. The increase in OSs in binary code size is less than 1.5%, and the time required for individual state transitions is on the order of a single millisecond. This scaling is the first in the world to make possible the dynamic changing of the number of processors within a security-domain on an ARM SMP. © 2009 ACM.","AMP; Dynamic security-domain scaling; SMP","AMP; Dynamic security; Dynamic security-domain scaling; New technologies; Processor resources; Scalable performance; Self-transition; SMP; State transitions; Symmetric multi-processors; Virtual address; Virtualization software; Binary codes; Embedded systems; Multiprocessing systems; Shape memory effect",,,,,,"Adams, K., Agesen, O., A comparison of software and hardware techniques for x86 virtualization (2006) International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems - ASPLOS, pp. 2-13. , DOI 10.1145/1168857.1168860, ASPLOS XII: Twelfth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems; (2005) AMD64 Virtualization Codenamed ""Pacifica"" Technology: Secure Virtual Machine Architecture Reference Manual, , http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/hunt/class/2005-fall/cs352/docsem64t/AMD/ virtualization-33047.pdf; (2004) ARM. 2004.

This collapsed karstic chamber contains a sequence of early Upper Paleolithic deposits that span an interval between roughly 29,000 and 41,000 (uncalibrated) radiocarbon years BP. Lithic assemblages can be assigned to two major chronostratigraphic units. The earliest assemblages correspond with the Initial Upper Paleolithic, whereas the most recent ones fit within the definition of the Ahmarian. Substantial assemblages of stone tools, vertebrate faunal remains, ornaments, osseous artifacts, and other cultural materials provide an unusually varied picture of human behavior during the earliest phases of the Upper Paleolithic in the northern Levant. The sequence at Üçaǧi{dotless}zli{dotless} Cave documents the technological transition between Initial Upper Paleolithic and Ahmarian, with a high degree of continuity in foraging and technological activities. The sequence also documents major shifts in occupational intensity and mobility. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A framework is presented which positions infrastructures within the context of societal transitions; offering a new perspective on infrasystems change. The different responses of and change modes for three different types of infrasystems (energy, water and mobility) over the course of transitions will be presented. The transition management approach is used to investigate the possibilities for steering radical change of the different infrasystem types. Consequently, we will formulate some tentative lessons and insights for infrasystem developers/designers, regulators and users on how to deal with, facilitate or induce radical change.",,"Added values; Transition management",,,,,,"Geels, F.W., Processes and patterns in transitions and system innovations: Refining the co-evolutionary multi-level perspective (2005) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 72, pp. 681-696; Rotmans, J., Societal innovation: Between dream and reality lies complexity (2005) Erasmus Research Institute of Management, , Erasmus University Rotterdam; Martens, P., Rotmans, J., (2005) Transitions in a Globalizing World, 37, pp. 1133-1144. , Futures; Jonsson, D.K., The nature of infrasystem services (2005) Journal of Infrastructure Systems, pp. 2-8. , ASCE, March; Loorbach, D., (2007) Transition Management, New Mode of Governance for Sustainable Development, , PhD Dissertation, Erasmus University Rotterdam, International Books; Kaijser, A., (2004) The Dynamics of Infrasystems, Lessons From History, pp. 153-166. , In, Proceedings of the 6th International Summer Academy on Technology Studies - Urban Infrastructure in Transition; Jonsson, D.K., Sustainable infrasystem synergies: A conceptual framework (2000) Journal of Urban Technology, 7 (3), pp. 81-104; Roos, D., Moavenzadeh, F., Neufville, R., Connors, S., The design and development of next generation infrastructrue systems (2004) 2004 IEEE International Conference on Systems, pp. 4662-4666. , In, Man and Cybernetics, Theme: Impacts of Emerging Cybernetics and Human-Machine Systems, October 10-13, The Hague, The Netherlands; Buck, B.H., Berg-Pollack, A., Assheuer, J., Zielinski, O., Kassen, D., Technical realization of extensive aquaculture constructions in offshore wind farms: Consideration of the mechanical loads (2006) Presented in the 25th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering, pp. 1-7. , 4-9 June, Hamburg, Germany/sponsored by Ocean, Offshore, and Arctic Engineering, ASME, New York, NY : American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2006; Buck, B.H., Krause, G., Rosenthal, H., (2004) Extensive Open Ocean Aquaculture Development Within Wind Farms in Germany: The Prospect of Offshore Co-management and Legal Constraints, 47 (3-4), pp. 95-122. , Ocean & Coastal Management; Calderon, C., Serven, L., The effects of infrastructure development on growth and income distribution (2004) World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3400; Canning, D., The contribution of infrastructure to aggregate output (1999) The World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 2246, , November 1999; Demetriades, P., Mamuneas, T., Intertemporal output and employment effects of public infrastructure capital: Evidence from 12 oecd economies (2000) The Economic Journal, 110, pp. 687-712; Röller, L.-H., Waverman, L., Telecommunications infrastructure and economic development: A simultaneous approach (2001) American Economic Review, 91, pp. 909-923; Fernald, J.G., Roads to prosperity?

The project aims (a) to learn from past transitions to help explore future transitions and what might enable or avoid them; (b) to design and evaluate transition pathways towards alternative socio-technical energy systems and infrastructures for a low carbon future; and (c) to understand and where appropriate model the changing roles, influences and opportunities of large and small 'actors' in the dynamics of transitions. The paper describes the approach being taken, which builds on the work of Dutch researchers on transitions and transition management using a multi-level framework of niches, socio-technical regime and landscape. It also outlines its application to the case of transition pathways to a regime dominated by local distributed electricity generation, including the evolution of the physical and institutional infrastructure changes, and the roles of actors, both large, e.g. multinational energy supply and distribution companies, national governments, major investors, and small, e.g. households, innovators and entrepreneurs.",,"Appropriate models; Distributed electricity generation; Distribution companies; Electricity system; Energy supplies; Energy systems; Low carbon; Multi-level; National governments; Socio-technical regimes; Sociotechnical; Transition management; Transition pathway; Electric generators",,,,,,"Rip, A., Kemp, R., Technological change (1998) Human Choices and Climate Change, 2. , ed.

China's rapid industrialization and economic growth have significantly increased its energy consumption. The issue of Greenhouse Gas mitigation poses a huge challenge to China to create an innovative and sustainable development pattern. Both theoretical and empirical studies imply that technological transition approach would be a suitable approach to achieve sustainable innovation for low-carbon economy. By analyzing the differences between disruptive innovations and radical innovations, we propose that to trigger technological transition in developing countries like China, disruptive innovations are wiser approaches than radical innovations. Then, we suggest a low-carbon technological transitions model which focuses on fostering disruptive innovations as triggers for low-carbon economy transition. ©2008 IEEE.","Disruptive innovation; Low-carbon economy; Technological transition","Carbon; Developing countries; Economics; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Carbon economies; Disruptive innovation; Disruptive innovations; Economic growths; Empirical studies; Energy consumption.; Greenhouse gas mitigations; Low-carbon economy; Radical innovations; Technological transition; Innovation",,,,,,"(2002) ENERGY WHITE PAPER: Our energy future-creating a low-carbon economy, , http://www.dti.gov.uk, http://www.berr.gov.uk; China: New Landscapes, China country Study, by Sustain Ability, 2007China's National Climate Change Programme (2007)Technological change and the environment.

This fundamental technological shift in core computing architecture will require a fundamental change in how we ensure the quality of software. The key issue is that verification techniques need to undergo a similarly deep technological transition to catch up with the complexity of software designed for the new hardware.

To date, however, the body-of-knowledge on energy infrastructure transitions is largely descriptive. Transition management, however, does have a prescriptive character - not only can we understand transitions, we can also shape them. This implies technical system design is augmented with policy, regulation, R&D strategies: some coherent all-inclusive set of transition instruments or transition assemblage. We conjecture a transition management strategy may equate to collaborative design of such a transition assemblage. Using foundations of complex systems theory, agent-based modeling, engineering and policy design scenario analysis, design of experiments and statistical data analysis, a modeling framework has been developed that enables ex-ante assessment of alternative transition assemblage design-alternatives.",,"Agent-based modeling; Collaborative design; Complex systems; Energy infrastructures; Fundamental changes; Modeling frameworks; Policy design; Scenario analysis; Sociotechnical systems; Statistical data analysis; Technical systems; Transition management; Design of experiments",,,,,,"Geels, F., (2002) Understanding the Dynamics of Technological Transitions, , vol.

We conjecture that the phenomenon of transitions is not sufficiently understood to merit high expectations from transition management since energy infrastructures are complex, large scale socio-technical systems. Transitions are not only multi-layered phenomena; they include feedback loops within and across layers. We have combined four complementary approaches - Socio-technical regimes, social theory, Institutional Economics and Actor-Network theory - to unravel the phenomenon of transitions and present a functional specification of a transition modelling framework. We suggest the development of a hybrid modelling approach to enable the analysis of transitions of socio-technical systems, to provide support to decision-makers involved in shaping their transition and to explore the feasibility of transition management.

Design/methodology/approach: Adopting an exploratory case study design, the paper triangulates both secondary and primary sources of data. Primary data were generated from self-completing questionnaire and interview schedule tools covering 105 local government employees selected from national, regional and district levels. Semi-structured interviews also solicited views from 16 senior public officers and managers in nine public and quasi-public organizations. These primary sources were complemented with relevant secondary documents from the organisations investigated. Findings: It was found that Ghana's PSR has significantly influenced the strategic direction of human resource development policies of the decentralized local government service. Major challenges in human resource capacity manifest themselves as related to policy, task, skill and organisation issues and performance motivation. Practical implications: Addressing the human resource capacity challenges has enormous strategic and financial resource implications for policy makers in transitional and developing economies, due to their over-reliance on external donors for funding. Originality/value: Unlike previous studies, this paper did not explore HR capacity issues of elected officials; rather, it focused on the public servants (technocrats) implementing local political decisions. Of much value is that the results were derived from the experience of frontline local government staff, whose day-to-day inputs are critical for effective decentralization. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decentralized government; Ghana; Government; Human resource development; Local government services; Public sector reform; Transition management",,,,,,,"Analoui, F., (1993) Training and Transfer of Learning, , Avbury, Aldershot; Analoui, F., (1996) Training and Transfer of Learning, , Ashgate, Aldershot; Analoui, F., Managerial perspectives, assumptions and development of human resource management (1998) Human Resource Management Issues in Developing Countries, , Analoui, F.

Design/methodology/approach - Robert Yin's positivistic multiple case study research method was used. Four primary modes of data collection were used in each of the three cases: observation during the five steps of the intervention, documentation review after the intervention, a pre- and post-survey, and individual interviews with the leader and the leader's direct reports approximately seven days after the last phase of the intervention. Findings - The researchers found support for their theory from a leader and team perspective. The three leaders in the study experienced accelerated learning, adaptation, and they built relationships with their teams. The leaders' teams experienced new learning and they built relationships with their new leaders. Research limitations/implications- The generalizability of findings is limited by the number of cases studied and by industry, leader, and team variation across cases. Practical implications - The study provides supporting evidence for the importance and effectiveness of leader assimilations in helping new leaders learn, adapt quickly, and build relationships with their teams early in their transition. Originality/value - The study is one of the first to report on the outcomes of an early leadership development intervention to help new leaders transition from one leadership role to another.","Leadership;

Given the slow movement towards a more sustainable mobility system, more radical, systemic innovation - a 'transition' - is required. Broadly speaking, this may be achieved via three routes: technological change, modal shift, and reduced travel demand. Drawing on concepts from the transitions literature (e.g., [Geels, F.W.: Technological Transitions and System Innovations: A Co-evolutionary and Socio-Technical Analysis, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2005.]), we conceptualise each of these routes as a bundle of niche activities within an Area of Innovation, deviating to differing degrees from the current mobility 'regime'. We present empirical evidence and indications of ongoing development of niches in these three areas within the UK and Sweden, and explore processes of co-evolution, divergence and tension within and between niches. Findings indicate recent market penetration of novel transport technologies, more advanced than modal shift or demand management activities; however, different transport technologies are more successful in each country. We also identify examples of a close relationship between development of radical vehicle/fuel technologies and provision of mobility services; and information technology as a driver in all three areas of innovation. We conclude that future innovation in transport depends on diversity, hybridisation, and co-evolution of niches. Finally, policy implications are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The emerging body-of-knowledge on system transitions to date remains largely descriptive, however. We propose a research agenda to develop a prescriptive system transition body-ofknowledge, which eventually will provide handles for policy makers to push and pull transitions. This agenda is developed by focusing on energy systems. We conjecture it is always sociotechnical systems that are the subject of transition. We define a system transition as a structural change in both technical and social subsystems. We conclude that shared definitions must be developed of indicators of sustainability performance of systems in transition. Secondly, an understanding and recognition of the socio-technical design space is required. The design space for energy systems includes technological structure and content, policy, regulation and market design and social innovation. The combination and interrelation of these must be recognized and its use suitably underpinned, for example by exploratory simulation models and games that would allow ex-ante testing of transition policies and management. © 2008 IEEE.","Energy; Simulation modeling and gaming; System transition; Transition Management","Design; Management; Models; Sustainable development; Technological forecasting; Energy; Simulation modeling and gaming; System transition; Transition Management; Innovation",,,,,,"Rotmans, (2004) Transitie management: Sleutel voor een duurzame samenleving, , Assen: Van Gorcum; Rotmans, J., Kemp, R., Asselt, M.V., Geels, F., Verbong, G., Molendijk, K., (2000) Transities & Transitiemanegement: De casus van emissiearme energivoorziening, , International Centre for Integrated Studies (ICIS) and Maastricht Economic Research Institute on Innovation and Technology MERIT, Maastricht; Geels, F.W., Processes and patterns in transitions and system innovations: Refining the co-evolutionary multi-level perspective (2005) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 72, pp. 681-696; Dijkema, G.P.J., (2004) Process System Innovation by Design, , Delft: Delft University of Technology; Ehrlich, P.R., Holdren, J.P., Impact of population growth (1971) Science, 171, pp. 1212-1217; Ehrlich, P.R., Holdren, J.P., One-dimensional economy (1972) Bull At Sci, 28, pp. 16-27; Working Group III (2001) Climate change 2001: Mitigation, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge; New York: Published for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [by] Cambridge University Press; Working Group III (2007) Climate Change 2007: Mitigation of Climate Change Summary for Policymakers, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Geneva: IPCC; (1998) Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, , UNFCCC; More with Energy, Opportunities for the Netherlands (2006) SenterNovem, , Task Force Energietransitie, Utrecht; Ministerie van Economische Zaken, Nu voor later, Energierapport 2005, Ministerie van Economische Zaken, Den Haag 2005Ministerie van Volkshuisvesting Ruimtelijke Ordening en Milieubeheer, Een wereld en een wil - werken aan duurzaamheid - Nationaal Milieubeleidsplan 4, Ministerie van Volkshuisvesting, Ruimtelijke Ordening en Milieubeheer, Den Haag 2001Herder, P.M., Bouwmans, I., Dijkema, G.P.J., Stikkelman, R.M., Weijnen, M.P.C., Designing Infrastructures Using a Complex Systems Perspective (2008) Journal of Design Research, , to be published in; Rotmans, J., Kemp, R., Van Asselt, M., More evolution than revolution: Transition management in public policy (2001) Foresight, 3, pp. 15-31; Timmermans, J., Complex dynamics in a transactional model of societal transitions Interjournal, , accepted for publication; F.

Faustino 74/B, 25122 Brescia, Italy","This paper aims to illustrate how social sciences, sociology in particular, have theorized on societal transitions. The first section introduces some preliminary definitions. The assumption is that a societal transition is more than a social, economic or technological change. It is a large-scale and long-term macro process through which a given social system radically changes its structural basis, in terms of new socio-technical practices, governance rules, social and economic institutions, cultural frames, and patterns of social life. The second section provides an excursus on social science accounts on transitions. In particular, the attention has been given to Norbert Elias' famous study on the rise and fall of the court society in France, between 17th and 18th century and to Manuel Castells' recent analysis of the emergence of the network society. The third section discusses problems and challenges of standard approaches and suggests some building blocks of societal transition models, taken from complexity and social simulation literature. The concluding section suggests some way-forward measures towards a computational social science approach to societal transitions. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Agent-based models; Manuel Castells; Norbert Elias; Social simulation; Societal transitions",,,,,,,"Aassve, A., Billari, F.C., Spéder, Z., Societal transition, policy changes and family formation: Evidence from Hungary (2006) Eur J Popul, 22 (2), pp. 127-152; Anderson, P., (1974) Lineages of the Absolutist State, , Verso, London; Axelrod, R., (1997) The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-based Models of Competition and Collaboration, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Ball, P., (2004) Critical Mass.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a content analysis approach, in which subject experts evaluate user-generated content produced as part of a project on inclusion and people with learning disabilities. Findings - Despite being only one theme of a number pertaining to transition, leisure, entertainment and hobby-related information dominated the web sites. Other issues elicited included that of writing about one's personal experiences providing limited information of use to others, the key role of carers/supporters in information provision, and some material being too difficult for people with learning disabilities to understand. Practical implications - The paper shows that for the information service to be valuable and relevant to the target audience, much training and considerable time investment are required for both people with learning disabilities and their supporters. The practice of creating and uploading information on to the web site holds benefits to the creator beyond mere information provision. Originality/value - The development of information services for people with learning disabilities by the service users themselves is an important innovation.

Our concern is that most transition models are too static. Although they capture a move of focus from static equilibria to transitions between dynamic equilibria, they are still rooted in an ""equilibriumist"" approach. Improvement is possible with agent-based models that give attention to endogenous system processes called ""transformation processes"". These models can render far more dynamic pictures of societal systems in transition, and are no longer remote from descriptions in the emerging transition literature. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Agent-based modelling; Integrated sustainability assessment; Societal transitions",,,,,,,"Axelrod, R., The evolution of strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (1997) The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-based Models of Competition and Collaboration, , In: Axelrod R (ed) Princeton University Press, Princeton; Bergman, N., Haxeltine, A., Whitmarsh, L., Modelling socio-technical transition patterns and pathways (2008) J Artif Soc Soc Simul, 11 (3), p. 7; de Haan, J., Pillars of change: A theoretical framework for transition models (2007) Symposium 'Modelling Transitions to Sustainability' at the ESEE 2007 Conference 'Integrating Natural and Social Sciences for Sustainability', , Paper presented at the; Fowler, J.H., Laver, M., A tournament of party decision rules (2008) J Confl Resolut, 52 (1), pp. 68-92; Frenken, K., (2006) Innovation, Evolution and Complexity Theory, , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham and Northampton; Geels, F.W., (2002) Understanding the Dynamics of Technological Transitions: A Co-evolutionary and Socio-technical Analysis, p. 426. , Centre for studies of Science, Technology and Society, Twente University, Enschede; Geels, F.W., Schot, J.W., Typology of socio-technical transition pathways (2007) Res Policy, 36 (3), pp. 399-417; Greene, D.L., Leiby, P., Tworek, E., Systems analysis of hydrogen transition with HytTrans (2006) Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2006, , In: Paper #06-2538; Haxeltine, A., Whitmarsh, L., Bergman, N., Conceptual framework for transition modelling (2008) Int J Innov Sustain Dev, 3 (1-2), pp. 93-114; Holling, C.S., Gunderson, L.H., Resilience and adaptive cycles (2002) Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Ecological Systems, pp. 25-62. , In: Gunderson LH, Holling CS (eds) Island Press, Washington; Kauffman, S., Adaptation on rugged fitness landscapes (1989) Lectures in the Science of Complexity, , In: Stein E (ed) Addison-Wesley, Reading; Kollman, K., Miller, J., Page, S., Adaptive parties in spatial elections (1992) Am Polit Sci Rev, 86, pp. 929-937; Kollman, K., Miller, J., Page, S., Political parties and electoral landscapes (1998) Br J Polit Sci, 28, pp. 139-158; Laver, M., Policy and the dynamics of political competition (2005) Am Polit Sci Rev, 99 (2), pp. 263-281; Laver, M., Schilperoord, M., Spatial models of political competition with endogenous political parties (2007) Philos Trans R Soc B, 362 (1485), pp. 1711-1721; Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., (1982) An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, , Belknap - Harvard University Press, Cambridge; Rip, A., Kemp, R., Technological change (1998) Human Choice and Climate Change, 2, pp. 327-399. , In: Rayner S, Malone EL (eds) Battelle Press, Columbus; Rotmans, J., (2005) Societal Innovation: Between Dream and Reality Lies Complexity, , ERIM, Erasmus Research Institute of Management, Rotterdam; Rotmans, J., Tools for integrated sustainability assessment: A two-track approach (2006) The Integr Assess J, 6 (4), pp. 35-57; Rotmans, J., Loorbach, D., Transition management: Reflexive governance of societal complexity through searching, learning and experimenting (2008) The Transition to Renewable Energy: Theory and Practice, , In: Van den Bergh JCJM, Bruinsma FR (eds) Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Rotmans, J., Kemp, R., van Asselt, M.B.A., More evolution than revolution: Transition management in public policy (2001) Foresight, 3 (1), pp. 15-32; Schelling, T., Dynamic models of segregation (1971) J Math Sociol, 1, pp. 143-186; Schwoon, M., Alkemade, F., Frenken, K., (2006) Flexible Transition Strategies Towards Future Well-to-wheel Chains: An Evolutionary Modelling Approach, , FNU working paper; Struben, J.R., (2006) Identifying Challenges for Sustained Adoption of Alternative Fuel Vehicles and Infrastructure, , http://ssrn.com/abstract=927012, MIT sloan research paper no. 4625-06.

The objective of this study is to explore the degree to which System Dynamics as an approach enhances the process of understanding transition dynamics in socio-technical systems. In other words, it is aimed to reveal the type of insights that can be developed about such systems and their dynamic behaviour using the approach, as well as the shortcomings of the approach in this challenging task. In order to do so, a modeling study aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms of the waste management transition in the Netherlands is conducted. The quantitative model developed is based on the historical case of the waste management transition of the Netherlands, and it portrays issues as the dynamics of actors' preferences, development of infrastructure and environmental consequences of dominant mode of functioning and provides an instance for demonstrating and evaluating the feedback-focused perspective discussed in this paper. Finally, the paper discusses a set of points regarding the utilized approach, System Dynamics, observed during this study both in general and in the specific context of transitions. In short, System Dynamics stands as a promising approach mainly due to its strength in explaining the source of complex dynamics based on interacting feedback loops, but it also has certain drawbacks in the context of transitions. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Simulation model; System dynamics; Transitions; Waste management",,,,,,,"Barlas, Y., Formal aspects of model validity and validation in system dynamics (1996) Syst Dyn Rev, 12 (3), pp. 183-210; Barlas, Y., Kanar, K., A dynamic pattern-oriented test for model validation (1999) Proceedings of 4th Systems Science European Congress, , http://www.ie.boun.edu.tr/~ybarlas/BarlasKorhan99.pdf, In: Valencia, 1999; Berkhout, F., Smith, A., Stirling, A., (2004) Socio-technological Regimes and Transition Contexts, Chap 3.

This overview first leads to the conclusion that computational and mathematical approaches and their practical form, modeling, up till now, have been almost absent in the research and theorizing of structural change or transitions in social systems. Second, this review of the social science literature suggests numerous theoretical constructs relevant for transition modeling. Relevant concepts include the conceptualization of the micro-to-macro link, the importance of explaining both stability and change, quantitative and qualitative definitions of structural change, the use of dichotomies, synchronic and diachronic reasoning in explaining structural change, definitions of basic patterns of social change, the conceptualization of resistance to change and intentional and normative aspects of social change.

A transition is conceptualised as a fundamental shift in the functioning of a societal system. The framework views functioning as a real-valued field defined upon a real variable. The initial status quo prior to a transition is captured in a field called the regime and the alternative that possibly takes over is represented in a field called a niche. Think for example of a transition in an energy supply system, where the regime could be centrally produced, fossil fuel based energy supply and a niche decentralised renewable energy production. The article then proceeds to translate theoretical notions on the interactions and dynamics of regimes and niches from transition literature into the language of this framework. This is subsequently elaborated in some simple models and studied analytically or by means of computer simulation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Partial differential equations; Societal transitions; Strategic niche management",,,,,,,"Avelino, F., (2007) Power in Transition, , www.ksinetwork.nl, KSI working paper.

An IT service, defined as a means to provide value to a consumer, may be realized by a network of shared application and other resources that are invoked in the context of business processes. In the spirit of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) we consider each application or resource as a service. Changing services or service definitions in such an environment includes exceptionally high risk and complexity, as various business processes might depend on a service. In this paper we propose a model for analyzing the business impact of operational risks resulting from change related service downtimes of uncertain duration. The proposed solution takes into account the network of dependencies between services where services may or may not be realized through business processes. Based on the analytical model, we derive decision models in terms of deterministic and probabilistic mathematical programming formulations to schedule single or multiple correlated changes efficiently. Preliminary experiments are described to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed models. Using these decisions models, organizations can schedule service changes with the lowest expected impact on the business. ©2008 IEEE.","Business impact analysis; Business-driven IT management; Change management; Change scheduling; Service transition management; Service-oriented architectures","Chlorine compounds; Decentralized control; Decision support systems; Information services; Information technology; Management; Mathematical programming; Production control; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Safety engineering; Scheduling; Ubiquitous computing; Analytical modelling; Business impact; Business impact analysis; Business processes; Business requirements; Business-driven IT management; Change management; Change scheduling; Cost drivers; Decision modeling; Decision supports; Network operations; Operational risks; Service delivery; Service disruptions; Service transition management; Service-Oriented Architecture; Service-oriented architectures; Transition management; Ubiquitous networks; Network management",,,,,,"Change Control Management, , http://www.crm2day.com/news/crm/118482.php, CRM Today:, URL; Office of Government Commerce: ITIL Service Support.

Box 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Coleman's equilibrium model of social development, the Linear System of Action, is extended to cover the dynamics of societal transitions. The model implemented has the characteristics of a dissipative system. A variation and selection algorithm favoring the retention of relatively dependent actors forces the system away from equilibrium, while exchange of control, according to Coleman the driving force behind social action, accounts for dissipation, pulling the social system back to equilibrium. This Non-linear System of Action self-organizes into a critical state, as confirmed by the robust power law distribution of exchange of control for a wide range of model sizes. Related punctuated equilibrium dynamics and structural change are of special interest, as these are closely connected to hypotheses on social dynamics developed in the literature on societal transitions. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Coleman;

By contrast, all the objects from the succeeding Mongolian empire period (AD 12th-15th) belong to the second group, indicating that a technological transition had occurred during the Khitan period. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) on carbon samples extracted from artifacts in both groups and measurement of alloy compositions suggest that the use of mineral coal in smelting was a major factor for this transition. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

As society faces unprecedented and increasingly urgent challenges associated with accelerating environmental change, resource scarcity, increasing inequality and injustice, as well as rapid technological change, new opportunities for higher education are emerging. Design/methodology/approach - The paper builds on the emerging literature on transition management and identifies five critical issues to be considered in assessing the potential for higher education as a change agent in any particular region or place. To demonstrate the value of these critical issues, exemplary challenges and opportunities in different contexts are provided. Findings - The five critical issues include regional-specific dominant sustainability challenges, financing structure and independence, institutional organization, the extent of democratic processes, and communication and interaction with society. Originality/value - Given that the challenges and opportunities for higher education as a change agent are context-specific, identifying, synthesizing, and integrating common themes is a valuable and unique contribution. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change management; Higher education; Sustainable development; Transition management",,,,,,,"(2004) Sustainability on Campus, Stories and Strategies for Change, , Barlett, P.F.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews key concepts in NPD andknowledge management (KM), leading to propositions about the effective management of NPD-relevant knowledge. It develops a structured, holistic model of organizational KM including practical mechanisms and processes for managing knowledge transfer. Findings - Effective knowledge management needs to: acknowledge the multiple organizational levels at which knowledge is deployed; support the production, elicitation and exchange of tacit knowledge as well as explicit, codified information; hence accommodate and enable both informal and formal, typically IS/IT enabled knowledge processes. Practical implications - KM is work-in-progress, not a one-time search for an idealised state. Computer-enabled information systems are necessary but not sufficient elements of a comprehensive approach to KM. Holistic KM should be integral to the organization, working with not against the grain of its technical, social and cultural processes. Senior managers with titles such as ""chief knowledge officer"" may be crucial in establishing strategic priorities and change programmes, but all NPD personnel bear responsibility for effective KM. Originality/value - The paper combines propositions about the effectiveconduct of KM for NPD with a model of holistic KM that involves multi-level flux and constructive knowledge transition. It identifies practical mechanisms, IS/IT enabled and otherwise, in this context. It suggests that new research to identify effective KM practices in NPD is a priority for KM researchers.","Innovation; Knowledge management; Product development; Tacit knowledge; Transition management",,,,,,,"Alavi, M., Tiwana, A., ""Knowledge integration in virtual teams: The potential role of KMS"" (2002) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 53 (12), pp. 1029-1037; Blackler, F., Crump, N., McDonald, S., ""Organizational learning and organizational forgetting: Lessons from a high technology company"" (1999) Organizational Learning and the Learning Organization, , in Araujo, L., Burgoyne, J. and Easterby-Smith, M.

This article assesses two paradigms for transiting to a low-carbon future in India. An integrated modelling framework is used for delineating and assessing the alternative development pathways having equal cumulative CO2 emissions during the first half of the 21st century. The first pathway assumes a conventional development pattern together with a carbon price that aligns India's emissions to an optimal 550 ppmv CO2e stabilization global response. The second emissions pathway assumes an underlying sustainable development pattern characterized by diverse response measures typical of the sustainability paradigm. A comparative analysis of the alternative development strategies is presented on multiple indicators such as energy security, air quality, technology stocks and adaptive capacity, and conclusions are drawn. © 2008 Earthscan.","Carbon pricing; Climate change; Developing countries; Development pathways; Energy mix; India; Low-carbon society; Scenario modelling; Sustainble development","carbon emission; climate change; comparative study; emission control; environmental planning; environmental policy; policy development; sustainability; sustainable development; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia",,,,,,"(1999) User Manual: ANSWER-MARKAL, an Energy Policy Optimisation Tool, Version 3.3.4, , ABARE, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Canberra; (2005) AIM-CGE [Country]: Data and Program Manual, , AIM Japan Team, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan; Alcamo, J., Shaw, R., Hordijk, L., (1990) The RAINS Model of Acidification: Science and Strategies in Europe, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands; Arrow, K., Dasgupta, P., Goulder, L., Daily, G., Ehlrich, P., Heal, G., Levin, S., Walker, B., Are We Consuming Too Much?

Central among factors shaping the latter behaviour (job insecurity, unstable partnership relationships, expensive housing, and profound changes in norms, values and attitudes) were the following: increasing proportions of young people were acquiring advanced education, a majority of women were gainfully employed, yet women were performing most household maintenance and childrearing duties. Two theories prevailed to explain what caused changes in family formation and fertility trends. One argues that the economic and social crises were the principal causes. The other considered the diffusion of western norms, values and attitudes as the prime factors of change. Neither reveals the root cause: the replacement of state socialist regimes with economic and political institutions of contemporary capitalism. The extraordinarily low period TFRs around 2000 were the result of low fertility of older women bom around 1960 overlapping with low fertility of young women, born during the 1970s. © 2008 Frejka.",,,,,,,,"Aliaga, C., How is the time of women and men distributed in Europe?

Box 1279, 00101 Helsinki, Finland","In this article radical change in the context of sustainable development is seen as a long-term process in which steady progress in the right direction is regarded as more essential than quick success. The author argues that pressing for swift radical changes bears a serious risk of becoming counter productive, because:{A figure is presented}pressing for rapid change is often wasteful and may prevent the best possible ways of exploitation of innovations;{A figure is presented}rapid change over a wide front of applications and sectors is usually impossible;{A figure is presented}pressing for rapid changes usually encounters strong opposition from interest groups, thereby risking to get bogged down in acceptability discourses. Transition management, such as for a transition towards sustainable consumption seems often to presuppose the need for radical changes. Even though the embedding function of transition management is a helpful concept and tool for sustainable consumption strategies, the lack or the negligence of the role of objective functions is a disturbing feature of transition management theories. All in all, the need for radical change should emerge as the transition process unfolds. There is no good scientific reason for a priori claims for radical changes as a kind of new dogma. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy systems are best understood as socio-technical arrangements with a strong interrelation of technological and social elements such as institutions, regulations, cultural values, social practices as well as interests, expectations and relationships of the actors involved. Such a perspective also gives us a better grasp of the ongoing dynamics of energy system transformation and stimulates new approaches to the governance of transition processes towards sustainability. Contributions of social sciences can support the understanding and shaping of energy transitions in an analytic, projective and reflexive dimension.

Our overall aim is to outline design principles for models that can offer new insights into tackling persistent problems in large-scale systems, such as the European road transport system or the regional management of water resources. The systemic nature of these problems is associated with them being complex, uncertain and cutting across a number of sectors, and indicates a need for radical technological and behavioural solutions that address changes at the systems level rather than offering incremental changes within sub-systems. Model design is inspired by recent research into transitions, an emerging paradigm which provides a framework for tackling persistent problems. We use concepts from the literature on transitions to develop a prototype of a generic 'transition model'. Our prototype aims to capture different types of transition pathways, using historical examples such as the transition from horse-drawn carriages to cars or that from sailing ships to steam ships. The model combines agent-based modelling techniques and system dynamics, and includes interactions of individual agents and sub-systems, as well as cumulative effects on system structures. We show success in simulating different historical transition pathways by adapting the model's parameters and rules for each example. Finally, we discuss the improvements necessary for systematically exploring and detailing transition pathways in empirical case-study applications to current and future transitions such as the transition to a sustainable transport system in Europe. © Copyright JASSS.","Agent-Based Modelling; Complex Systems; Social Simulation; Transition Theory; Transitions",,,,,,,"BERGMAN, N., Whitmarsh, L., Köhler, J., Haxeltine, A., Schilperoord, M., Assessing transitions to sustainable housing and communities in the UK (2007) International Conference on Whole Life Urban Sustainability and its Assessment, , Horner, M, Hardcastle, C, Price A and Bebbington J Eds, Glasgow; BERGMAN, N., Whitmarsh, L., Köhler, J., Transition to sustainable development in the UK housing sector: From case study to model implementation (2008) UEA: Tyndall Centre Working Paper; Innovation Adoption in Agriculture: Innovators, Early Adopters and Laggards Cahiers d'Economie et Sociologie Rurales, pp. 30-50. , DIEDEREN, P, van Meijl, H, Wolters, A, and Bijak, K 2003, 67, pp; DOSI, G., (1984) Technical Change and Industrial Transformation, , London: Macmillan; (2004) System Innovation and the Transition to Sustainability: Theory, Evidence and Policy, , ELZEN, B, Geels, F W and Green, K Eds, Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar; GEELS, F.W., (2002) Understanding the dynamics of technological transitions: A co-evolutionary and socio-technical analysis, , Enschede, The Netherlands: Twente University Press; GEELS, F.W., Processes and patterns in transitions and system innovations: Refining the co-evolutionary multi-level perspective (2005) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 72 (6), pp. 681-696; GEELS, F.W., (2005) Technological Transitions and System Innovation: A Coevolutionary and Socio-Technical Analysis, , Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar; GEELS, F.W., The hygienic transition from cesspools to sewer systems (1840-1930): The dynamics of regime transformation (2006) Research Policy, 35 (7), pp. 1069-1082; GEELS, F.W., Major system change through stepwise reconfiguration: A multi-level analysis of the transformation of American factory production (1850-1930) (2006) Technology in Society, 28 (4), pp. 445-476; GEELS, F.W., Schot, J., Taxonomy of transitions pathways in socio-technical systems (2005) Presented at workshop by the ESRC Sustainable Technologies Program, May 12, 2005, , London; GEELS, F.W., Schot, J., Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways (2007) Research Policy, 36, pp. 399-417; GIDDENS, A., (1984) The Constitution of Society, , Cambridge: Polity Press; HAXELTINE, A., Whitmarsh, L., Bergman, N., Rotmans, J., Schilperoord, M., A Conceptual Framework for transition modelling (2008) International Journal of Innovation and Sustainable Development, 3 (1-2), pp. 93-114. , and KöhlerJ; HOOGMA, R., Kemp, R., Schot, J., Truffer, B., (2002) Experimenting for Sustainable Transport Experimenting for Sustainable Transport: The approach of strategic niche management, , Routledge: London, New York; KEMP, R., Rip, A., Technological Change (1998) Human Choice and Climate Change, 2, pp. 327-399. , Rayner, S and Malone, E L Eds, Columbus, Ohio: Battelle Press; KÖHLERJ, Grubb, M, Popp, D and Edenhofer, O (2006) 'The transition to endogenous technical change in climate-economy models: A technical overview to the Innovation Modeling Comparison Project'.

From this perspective, a number of starting points are suggested for energy transition management in order to influence the speed and direction of the energy transition. In the second part of this paper, these principles are used to reflect upon the way the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently applying transition management. As such, this paper itself is part of the ongoing co-production of knowledge between science and policy, that emerged over the past few years in the Netherlands with regard to transition management.

In this new educational environment, radical societal transitions and the opportunities afforded by modern communication technologies together produce formidable challenges. Significant as these challenges may be, concentration upon problems of a practical kind draws attention away from the more theoretical concerns in understanding e-learning. By drawing together developments in social, educational and communicational theory and Gilly Salmon's hands-on approach to teaching and learning online, this article reveals some unintended consequences: e-moderation and the use of e-tivities may perpetuate the very conditions that limit our chances of dealing successfully with the challenges posed by e-learning. While theory may muddle what might otherwise be communicated meaningfully to those in search of practical answers, theoretical developments provide concepts and frameworks that can be placed in the service of a critical understanding of e-learning and the transformation of social interaction in higher education. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","e-learning; e-moderation; e-tivities; Interaction; Reflexive modernization; Social theory",,,,,,,"Allen, B.S., Constructive criticisms (1992) Constructivism and the technology of instruction: A conversation, pp. 183-204. , ed.

This view has lead to an increase in the amount of research carried out about the so-called ""transitions"". Transitions comprise long-term, fundamental change in societal subsystems and are seen as encompassing co-evolutionary and mutually reinforcing processes in the economic, technological, institutional and socio-cultural domains. Transition research aims at understanding transitions and at finding methods that facilitate change directed towards societal goals (so-called ""transition management""). This paper adds to the growing body of concepts of this young research strand. It suggests a framework for defining and describing ""regimes"", the systems resulting from the broad and interdisciplinary view taken by transition research. The concept ""regime"" is of central importance for transition research, since it defines the level of societal systems on which transitions are mainly analysed. What actually is ""the regime"" to be researched and possibly managed is however usually not given through clear system boundaries but is a matter of framing and deliberation. In order to guide processes of regime identification, the paper develops five defining characteristics of regimes and gives a definition based on them. Further a method useful to structure and graphically represent knowledge about a regime is introduced. Such a structuring of knowledge is an important first step to understand how a regime ""works"". © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It is designed to facilitate the introduction and diffusion of new sustainable technologies through protected societal experiments in fields such wind energy, biogas, public transport systems, electric vehicle transport and eco-friendly food production. A major challenge in SNM concerns the processes by which such experiments can evolve into viable market niches and ultimately contribute to a broader shift towards sustainable development. This paper sheds more light on this issue by systematically consolidating the main SNM studies, and by bringing in new insights from the literature that is in some sense complementary to SNM.

This paper addresses this question by developing a model of technological evolution that incorporates both technological trajectories and a new concept: preference trajectories, which are cycles of incremental and discontinuous change in preferences. Preference discontinuities turn out to play an important role in triggering technological transitions in an industry. I illustrate the model with an historical study of the typesetter industry, which underwent three major technological transitions, each of which was driven by preference discontinuities.

In general, the market logic of modernisation and competition for innovation combined with the market potential of global environmental needs serve as important driving forces behind ""ecological modernisation"". In recent times, however, additional factors like rising energy prices or fears from climate change have favoured the rise of this innovation-based approach to environmental policy. The article deals with two special driving forces: first, there is growing evidence for the importance of ""smart"" environmental regulation. Secondly, the increasingly complex actor constellation of global environmental governance leads to mounting business risks for polluters and thereby exerts pressure for eco-innovation. Despite these favourable framework conditions, the strategy of ""ecological modernisation"" nonetheless faces a number of inherent limitations. These include the unavailability of marketable technological solutions for relevant environmental problems like the loss of species, the rebound effect neutralising the incremental environmental improvements through economic growth (the dilemma of the ""N-curve"") as well as resistance by ""modernisation losers"". Against this background, structural solutions seem indispensable. Here, eco-innovations should be supported by transition management or ecological structural policy. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This qualitative study examined how the competing pressures of modernization and traditionality impinge on Nepali women who are attempting to both resist patriarchal restrictions and preserve long-established cultural values. The large majority of participants expressed ambivalence toward beauty contests in Nepal. They expressed the belief that beauty pageants can help to empower Nepali women, facilitate progress in Nepal, and present Nepal positively on a global stage. Moreover, participants called for the perceived benefits of pageant participation to be extended to rural, impoverished, and lower caste Nepali women. At the same time, participants expressed reservations about Nepali women being objectified by their participation in these contests, deplored their commercial aspects, and felt that beauty pageants could contribute to the development of body image disturbance. Their ambivalence may reflect their conflicting positioning as middle-class citizens and as women in a developing consumer economy that retains strong patriarchal norms. Their complex and conflicting responses help to elucidate the process of gendered social change in a developing country during a time of rapid societal transition. © 2008 SAGE.","Body image; Modernization; Nationalism; Nepal; Objectification",,,,,,,"Ahmed-Ghosh, H., Writing the Nation on the Beauty Queen's Body: Implications for a ""hindu"" Nation (2003) Meridians, 4, pp. 205-27; Press, A., (2006) 'Miss Nevada Katie Rees Fired over Raunchy Photos, , http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,237897,00.html, 2007; Banet-Weiser, S., (1999) The Most Beautiful Girl in the World: Beauty Pageants and National Identity, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; (1996) Beauty Contest in Bangalore: Crony Capitalism on Catwalk, , http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_1996/october/feature.htm, Bangalore Unit of AIPWA, Campaign against Miss World Beauty Contest 2007; Botta, R., Television Images and Adolescent Body Image Disturbance (1999) Journal of Communications, 47, pp. 22-41; Browne, M., Of All Things: All the Rage in Nepal (2004) Financial Times, , http://search.ft.com/nonFtArticle?id=040826008537, 2007; Cohen, B.C., Wilk, R., Stoeltje, B., (1996) Beauty Queens on the Global Stage: Gender, Contests, and Power, , New York: Routledge; Crawford, M., Kaufman, M., Gurung, A., Women and children last: The effects of the maoist insurgency on gender-based violence (2007) Contentious Politics and Democratization: Maoist Insurgency, Identity Politics and Social Movements in Nepal, pp. 95-119. , M.

It argues that the current government strategy, investment policy and industrial interest are over-emphasized on biomass-burning power generation as part of the clean energy development trajectories, which may not lead to the most cost-effective outcomes in terms of investments, resource use and social development objectives. It points out that there are large potentials in developing and disseminating household-based biomass technologies in rural areas, especially with energy-efficient modern biomass stoves, which can produce far more economic, social and environmental benefits than biomass power plants. It is a decentralized solution to use renewable energy resources for meeting multi-objectives. It is suggested that key incentive policies be provided by the government to encourage this technological transition, or the leapfrogging from using traditional household stoves towards modern biomass stoves, which will lead to a win-win situation in global, regional and local environmental protection, sustainable resource management and related social benefits, particularly for the poor in remote communities. Six policy recommendations are made: (1) financial schemes development; (2) preferable tax and carbon tax; (3) regulatory policy reform; (4) service industry support; (5) market research, training and capacity building for key stakeholders; (6) development of methodologies and standards for CDM projects. The potential co-benefits brought up by this massive biomass technology transition will bring new perspectives to realizing Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and global CO2 emissions reduction targets in China, and also set an example to other developing countries. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This transition is difficult for both those who make it and those who do not, and may cause good engineers to become derailed managers. On the basis of career stage theory, this study proposes an instrument to explore the career states of midcareer and older engineers. The sample came from 254 members of the Chinese Institute of Engineers in Taiwan. The proposed career stage measurement, which combines organizational position ranks and personal perceptions of autonomy and influence at work, provides a valid frame for tracking career stages. The results differentiate six career stages, including one composed mostly of engineers in middle-level management positions who apparently have fallen off track. Compared with on-track careerists, these derailed managers perceive less job success and perceive fewer up-front managerial skill requirements. They appear less self-motivating and self-learning during their managerial transitions. Both the background of the sample, which offers some causes of this derailed situation, and the abilities that engineers need to avoid derailment as they progress from one managerial stage to another are presented. © 2008 IEEE.","Career stage; Derailment; Engineering managers; Managerial transition","Engineers; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Career stage theory; Managerial transition; Management",,,,,,"Allen, N., Meyer, J.P., Organizational commitment: Evidence of career stage effects?

However, the societal transition in China, Russia, and the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe has confronted the sociology of development with a series of new issues for which existing approaches may not be adequate: How should one evaluate the various paths to development in different countries and regions? How should one examine the state-society relationship in social development and transition? How can one deal with the social inequality in the process of development? These topics have expanded the scope of the sociology of development and provided an opportunity to construct new theories. I suggest that, in response to the ongoing societal transition, the field of the sociology of development needs, in addition to theories of modernization and theories of development, theories of transition. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Modernization theories; Societal transition; Sociology of development; Theories of transition","modernization; social conflict; social development; state-local relations",,,,,,"Amin, S., (1976) Unequal Development: An Essay on the Social Formation of Peripheral Capitalism, , New York: Monthly Review Press; Arendt, H., (1951) The Origins of Totalitarianism (Jiquan Zhuyi).

As for the last decade, the technological aspects of civil engineering material development can be divided into two parts. The damage by the Great Hanshin Earthquake to civil structures has changed the principal design codes for bridges and port structures and so on. According to the changes of design criteria the required performance of civil engineering materials changed a lot. Consequently, several earthquake-resistant construction methods are developed. During the latter half of this decades the Japanese government decided to reduce the public construction budget. To meet the cost saving construction demand, some new civil engineering structural materials are also developed to decrease the material costs.",,"Civil structure; Construction budget; Construction method; Cost saving; Design codes; Design criterion; Hanshin Earthquake; Market needs; Material cost; Structural materials; Structural steels; Technological aspects; Technological development; Technological transition; Building materials; Civil engineering; Earthquakes; Engineering; Fenders (port structures); Martensitic stainless steel; Steel construction; Surveys; Technological forecasting; Bridges",,,,,,,"Kawabata, N.; Structurals Div.",,,,,,,,,,NSTTD,,,"English","Nippon Steel Technical Report",Article,Scopus

The pivotal question is how to understand and manage such transitions. The literature on adaptive management addresses this question in part, but must now move beyond the descriptive toward a prescriptive management framework. Transition management theory could help in meeting this challenge. The similarity of the theoretical starting points yet different applications offer fertile conditions for cross-pollination. We investigate three central concepts from the transition management literature for their potential contribution to adaptive management. In particular, the notions of arenas and shadow networks merit further study through joint research.

The 11 new dates confirm 1) the late spread of Neolithic economy and technology into the Atlantic environment of Cantabrian Spain by about 4500 cal BC; 2) the horizontally extensive, but not intensive, use of the whole cave vestibule by Upper Magdalenian foragers about 12,000-14,000 cal BC; 3) extensive and very intensive, repeated occupations of the cave during the Middle and Lower Cantabrian Magdalenian about 14,200-17,000 cal BC; and 4) a long, gradual technological transition from the Solutrean to the Archaic Magdalenian between about 20,000-17,000 cal BC. El Mirón joins a list of culturally very rich, frequently occupied, Lower Magdalenian residential hub sites-most of the rest of which (including Altamira) are located in the coastal lowlands of Cantabria-which have yielded distinctive red deer scapulae that are decorated with striated engraved images of game animals (mainly red deer hinds), now most precisely dated at El Mirón between 16,200-17,200 cal BC. © 2007 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.",,"Animalia; Cervus elaphus",,,,,,"Alday Ruiz, A., The transition between the last huntergatherers and the first farmers in southwestern Europe: The Basque perspective (2005) Journal of Anthropological Research, 61 (4), pp. 469-94; Altuna, J., Cuenca, G., Elorza, M., García, J., Lobo, J., Mariezkurrena, K., Pérez, M., Straus, L.G., Post-Pleistocene faunas from the archaeological site of El Mirón Cave: A preliminary summary (2002) Miscelánea En Homenaje a Emilio Aguirre, 2, pp. 40-49. , In: Baquedano E, Rubio S, editors, (Zona Arqueológica 4), Alcalá: Museo Arqueológico Regional; Arias, P., The origins of the Neolithic along the Atlantic coast of continental Europe: A survey (1999) Journal of World Prehistory, 13 (4), pp. 403-64; Barandiarán, I., Datation C14 de l'art mobilier magdalénien cantabrique (1988) Bulletin De La Société Préhistorique Ariège-Pyrénées, 43, pp. 63-84; Bernaldo de Quirós, F., Cabrera Valdés, V., Cronología del arte paleolítico (1994) Complutum, 5, pp. 265-76. , In Spanish; Cattelain, P., Propulseurs magdaléniens: Marqueurs culturels régionaux?

Given the technologies now in use to sustain the current world economy, these 1000's of terawatt-hours of new energy must come in the form of both electrical power and a variety of fuels. Although this energy will come from various sources, Space Solar Power is one of the more important options for safe, affordable and abundant energy on this scale. However, any shift from one suite of large-scale, infrastructure-intensive technologies to another can take decades to realize. Examples have included the transitions from water-borne transport to rail-carried transport of freight, from wood to coal, and others. All of these major technological transitions have required ""local"" economic feasibility to be realized, including both locally in time and space (payback within a few years to a decade, with revenues drawn within some relatively predictable economic setting). In other words, the decision to make the transition must somehow be rational-it must make sense for individual decision makers. Almost certainly, the same must be true for Space Solar Power. The key to ""locally rational"" decisions that lead to space solar power is three fold. First, the technologies to be developed must have applications that are nearer term and multi-faceted. Second, interim systems must be possible that provide value to decisionmakers/investors within both government and industry. And, finally Space Solar Power pilot plants must be possible that are affordable, have value and retire risks-while providing legitimate energy services. This paper will explore these questions, focusing on the potential pathways by which affordable and abundant Space Solar Power may be realizable.",,"Coal transportation; Earth atmosphere; Economics; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Pilot plants; Power plants; Solar power plants; Decision makers; Earth's atmospheres; Economic feasibilities; Economic settings; Electrical powers; Energy services; Infra-structure; Interim systems; Large-scale; Per capita; Quality of lives; Solar powers; Space solar powers; Terawatt; World economies; Solar energy",,,,,,"Campbell, C.

The article discusses methods for choosing business cases for discussion and analysis that are relevant to the students' level of experience. The authors show how to use the cases over the period of individual courses and within comprehensive degree programs.

A generic micro grid configuration is assumed. The approach is elaborated with a specific micro grid configuration containing a self-excited induction machine based wind energy conversion system. By definition a micro grid operates in both grid-connected and in isolated modes. In each mode of operation there could be different combinations of the available energy sources in the system that are catering to the load demand. A hybrid control scheme which utilizes different control mechanisms for optimal control of a system under different operating conditions and in different operating states, presents an attractive paradigm for the control design of such a system. By partitioning a micro grid into different modules along suitable axis, the complexity of a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) control problem of the system can be significantly reduced. The control of the different modules of a micro grid system can then be tackled using the well established linear control theory which could then be combined using suitable transition, load and power management strategies to achieve optimal control of the micro grid system in all its desirable operating states. Supervisory hybrid control of a wind energy conversion and storage system is presented to illustrate the supervisory hybrid control design and analysis philosophy outlined in this paper. © 2007 IEEE.","Finite hybrid automata; Micro grid; Supervisory hybrid control; Transition management; Wind energy conversion system","Control designs; Control mechanisms; Control problems; Design and analysis; Different operating conditions; Electrical power; Energy sourcing; Finite hybrid automata; Grid-connected; Hybrid control; Hybrid control design; Hybrid control scheme; Induction machines; Isolated modes; Linear control theory; Load demand; Micro grid; Micro grids; Mode of operations; Multiple input multiple output MIMO); Operating states; Optimal control; Power management strategies; Storage systems; Supervisory hybrid control; Systematic approaches; Transition management; Wind energy conversion; Wind energy conversion system; Automation; Cellular radio systems; Chlorine compounds; Control system analysis; Crack propagation; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy conversion; Energy management; Energy storage; Intersections; Linear control systems; Machine design; MIM devices; Philosophical aspects; Wind power; Control theory",,,,,,"Larsen, H., Petersen, L.S., (2002) New and Emerging Technologies - Options for the Future, , Riso: Energy Report 1, Riso National Laboratory, Denmark, Oct; J.

An adaptive-length filter can provide a resource manager with alternatives that can be used if resources become scarce. This paper discusses the use of standard IIR filters used in controls applications, such as a Butterworth filter, and how this filter can be implemented in prioritized stages that can be skipped if necessary. The paper also examines the use of filter banks with different size filters. In both cases, transition management methods such as bumpless transfer are investigated to mitigate the transients induced when switching between filters. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Bumpless transfer; Butterworth filtering; Different sizes; In order; Real-time constraints; resource managers; Transition management; Filter banks; IIR filters; Standards; Wave filters",,,,,,"Murthy, C.S.R., Manimaran, G., (2001) Resource Management in Real-Time Systems and Networks, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Bartha, S., Gabriel, Z., Mezofi, L., Péceli, G., Signal Processing in Resource Insufficient Environments (2003) IEEE Int.

Its most important feature is its highly efficient use of processor resources, accomplished by dynamically changing the number of processors within a security domain in response to application load requirements. Two new technologies make this scaling possible without any virtualization software: 1) self-transition management and 2) unified virtual address mapping. Evaluations show that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs almost no performance overhead in security domains. The increase in binary code size is less than 40KB, and the time required for individual state transitions is of a single-millisecond order. This scaling is the first in the world to make possible dynamic changing of the number of processors within a security domain on an ARM SMP.

In order to prepare this mission, some studies are led to demonstrate the feasibility of the global project. The ICC2 project aimed at elaborating a full GNC system for a DARWIN precursor mission composed of an interferometric arm (2 telescopes and a hub recombiner). During this study a representative Matlab simulation tool was developed to validate the GNC design, this validation was completed by the implementation of the GNC Design on a real-time testbench which involves three LEON processors and dSPACE facilities. The software was mainly developed from the simulation tool using Matlab automatic code generation facilities. On this basis, AAS has carried on the development of these both tools in the frame of additional contracts with ESA. Thus the Matlab simulator allows today to run very complete sequences including : RF integer ambiguity resolution manoeuvre, convergence from coarsest stage until fringe acquisition, observation with OPD control, scanning manoeuvres. A FDIR strategy with different levels and collision avoidance algorithm have also been added. All the logic and the transition management between the different phases are realised thanks to Stateflow.","Darwin; FDIR; Formation flying; GNC","Collision avoidance; Global positioning system; Interferometers; MATLAB; Project management; Space applications; Formation flying; Global project; Interferometric arm; Spacecraft",,,,,,"Frenkiel, R., Mehlen, C., Radio-frequency technology and GNC for formation flying (2006), IAC-06-C1.3.7Mehlen, Radio frequency metrology and data-link instrument for formation flying missions (2006) 30th annual AAS Guidance and Control Conference, , to be published; Pirson L., Charbonnel C.

The wider contextual environment is to be explored, focusing on political, social and economic issues. Different elements of the health system including health policy, governance, service delivery, human resources and health financing are reviewed in the light of their development over the past decade. Design/methodology/approach - The paper shows that the Republic of Tajikistan is in transition. Formerly one of the most neglected republics within the USSR, the country became independent in 1990 and faced the civil conflict shortly thereafter. In the last few years there have been major public sector reforms with health reforms formally launched in the late 1990s. Little information about current Tajikistan is widely available. Findings - The paper finds that the progress of health reforms in Tajikistan has been relatively slow compared with neighbouring Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. This is largely due to the effects of civil war in the mid-1990s and significant out-migration of qualified experts, but it can also be attributed to an inability of central government to adequately adapt to the requirements of transition. Originality/value - The paper shows that many problems are still to be overcome by the health system, ranging from operational issues related to service delivery to strategic issues such as formulating an explicit privatisation policy, reducing fragmentation of, and aligning, external aid. However, some recent developments, such as adoption of a country health reform conception, a health financing strategy, and willingness of central government to improve coordination, suggest that improvements are possible. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Health services; Tajikistan; Transition management","adult; aged; article; female; health care delivery; health care policy; human; legal aspect; life expectancy; male; middle aged; organization and management; Tajikistan; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Health Care Reform; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Tajikistan",,,,,,"Coordination Unit, A., (2004) Foreign Aid Report 2003-2004, , Government of the Republic of Tajikistan Dushanbe; Coordination Unit, A., (2005) Foreign Aid Report 2003-2004, , ACU of the Executive Administration of the President of Tajikistan Government Press London; Aliev, H., (1997) Forming of Political System of Tajikistan: Political and Juridical Aspects, , Democratic Institutions, NATO Fellowship Program, unpublished; Cashin, C., (2004) Tajikistan Health Sector Note: Health Financing Report, , The World Bank Washington, DC unpublished; Cashin, C., Borowitz, M., Zuess, O., The gender gap in primary health care resources utilization in Central Asia (2002) Health Policy and Planning, 17 (3), pp. 264-72; Ensor, T., Rittmann, J., Reforming health care in the Republic of Kazakhstan (1997) International Journal of Health Planning and Management, 12, pp. 219-34; Falkingham, J., Inequality and changes in women's use of maternal health-care services in Tajikistan (2003) Studies in Family Planning, 34 (1), pp. 32-43; Falkingham, J., Poverty, out-of-pocket payments and access to health care: Evidence from Tajikistan (2004) Social Science and Medicine, 58, pp. 247-58; Gedik, G., Oztek, Z., Lewis, A., Modernizing primary health care (2002) Health Care in Central Asia, , McKee, M.

We are on a track to ecological and resource collapse if actions are not taken soon. Technology will have to play a key role in the process of changing industrial society. But innovation has to be embedded in social and organizational innovation. We need sociotechnical change. Environmentally conscious design has been practiced in engineering design for more than a decade. Its merits are sometimes blamed as futile, as the world has not witnessed a significant contribution to the solution of the larger (global) problems. This paper first sketches a scheme of the various levels of technological change, ranging from: (1) incremental optimizations of single artifacts, to (2) major change of artifacts, (3) systems change, and (4) technological transitions (involving changes in production and consumption). It outlines the stakeholders involved in these types of innovations and the parties that could orchestrate the innovation process. In this paper, It is argued that the most encompassing level of technological innovation, the level of transition, is crucial for achieving long-term sustainable development, as it has the largest potential for improvement. However, transition is not very well manageable. The paper contains a review of the literature regarding the occurrence of technological transitions. After a transition has occurred, the new system is often not efficient. Its gains in terms of diminished resource consumption or pollution have to be enlarged by less encompassing innovation strategies, such as systems innovations and product optimization. Transitions for sustainable development are often impossible, as the new systems have to compete with fully developed and optimized systems that have far advanced at the learning curve, i.e., are optimized by various systems and incremental innovations. Less encompassing levels of innovation, even those that aim at more sustainability, can counteract transitions that have more potential for sustainable development by improving the competing (unsustainable) technology. The paper will give several examples of this dilemma and some guidelines for developing government policies as well as corporate strategies. On the policy level, it is argued that it is especially important to develop (scope for) market niches for new sustainable systems and products as they create scope for experiments that could lead to transitions. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2007.","Backcasting; Innovation; Plastics; Scenario; Technology",,,,,,,"Abernathy, W.J., Clark, K.B., Innovation: Mapping the winds of creative destruction (1985) Res Policy, 14, pp. 3-22; (1987) The Social Construction of Technological Systems, New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology, , Bijker WE, Hughes TP, Pinch T (eds) MIT, Cambridge; Ehrlich, P.E., Holdren, J.P., Impact of population growth (1972) Population, Resources and the Environment, pp. 365-377. , In: Ridker RG (ed) US Government Printing Office, Washington; Graedel, T.E., Allenby, B.R., (1995) Industrial Ecology, , Prentice Hall, Englewood; Hughes, T., (1983) Networks of Power.

It is often argued that immature technologies rely on niches for their development, before they are able to compete in mainstream markets. This paper combines insights from economic theory and from technology studies to formulate a framework for understanding the dynamics of technological change in niches, and applies this framework to the case of fuel cell Auxiliary Power Units (APUs). We conclude that the choice of technology for APUs will be of critical importance in determining the role this market could have in shaping future developments in hydrogen and fuel cells. However, a number of factors are not strictly dependent on the technology used in fuel cell APUs. These comprise factors influencing external economies of scale, network effects, the behaviour of users and expectations. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

These transformations will be analysed as sociotechnical transition, using the multi-level perspective. One characteristic of the case is interactions between multiple regimes: radio and recording. Another characteristic is the presence of strong cultural components, with rock 'n' roll as proxy. These characteristics lead to theoretical adjustments in the multi-level perspective. Further analysis also suggests a particular transition path of reconfiguration, in which multiple niche-innovations cumulatively transform the regime. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

There is no widely agreed framework for evaluating such effectiveness. The author suggests that complexity theories may offer criteria. The relevant question is 'do Impact Assessment Procedures contribute to the ""requisite variety"" of a social system for it to deal with changing circumstances?' Requisite variety theoretically relates to the capability of a system to deal with changes in its environment. The author reconstructs how thinking about achieving sustainable development has developed in a sequence of discourses in The Netherlands since the 1970s. Each new discourse built on the previous ones, and is supposed to have added to 'requisite variety'.

This canton is a rural prealpine area, which has been historically shaped by traditional industries and which lies in the vicinity of St Gallen in the Greater Zürich Area. Scientists and regional stakeholders collaboratively planned, assessed, and discussed how to realize cooperative business strategies in order to sustain a continued presence in their selected industry. 101 stakeholders participated in a project, which made use of the area development negotiations method. This systematic and analytical method involved (a) the construction of different regional business strategies and clustering variants through formative scenario analysis, (b) a multicriteria evaluation of these variants, and (c) a multistakeholder consensus process on different forms of horizontal and vertical cooperation. As a result, a regional learning process with the ultimate goal of moving towards a sustainable development form was initiated between industries, public authorities, and research institutions. © 2007 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain.",,"corporate strategy; public sector; research institution; stakeholder; sustainability; textile industry; timber industry; Appenzell Outer Rhodes; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Switzerland",,,,,,"Amdam, J., Structure and strategy for regional learning and innovation.

This paper reflects on the inherent ambivalence of sustainability as a normative objective of steering and governance. It draws, in particular, on Bauman's account of the complex relationship between ambivalence, modernity and postmodernity, using these ideas to consider the strategic work involved in drawing boundaries around what is sustainable/unsustainable. The implications of the analysis are explored for conventional and reflexive approaches to the governance and management of socio-technical transitions. Strategies of reflexive governance promise to engage more openly and directly with the challenges of handling rather than eliminating ambivalent and changing goals. While these approaches bring some dimensions of ambivalence out into the open, they do so by framing debate in ways that background others, thereby obscuring the politics involved. The article concludes by turning the problem around and arguing that rather than being something managed through methods of governance, ambivalence is itself an outcome and a consequence of such techniques. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Governance; Sustainability; Transitions",,,,,,,"Aiking, H., Boer, J.D., Food sustainability: Diverging interpretations (2004) British Food Journal, 106 (5), pp. 359-365; Bauman, Z., (1991) Modernity and Ambivalence, , Ithaca: Cornell University Press; Berkhout, F., Smith, A., Stirling, A., Socio-technical regimes, path dependency and transition contexts (2004) System Innovation and the Transition to Sustainability: Theory, Evidence and Policy, pp. 48-75. , B.

'Governance on the outside' objectifies the socio-technical and is managerial in approach. 'Governance on the inside' is more reflexive about the role of governance in co-constituting the socio-technical and, consequently, more overtly political. Each conceptualization lends itself to contrasting strategies for dealing with uncertainty, ambiguity and power. Both forms exist to varying degrees in specific instances of socio-technical governance. Tensions between imperfect attempts to reconcile contradictions between the two drive governance dynamics. This paper develops a conceptual framework to help understand these dynamics. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Reflexive governance; Socio-technical transitions; Sustainable development",,,,,,,"Adam, B., Beck, U., van Loon, J., (2000) The Risk Society and Beyond: Critical issues for social theory, , London: Sage; Adams, R., City Diary (2002) Guardian, , 13 December; Arrow, K., (1963) Social Choice and Individual Values, , New Haven: Yale University Press; BBC (2007) BBC News, Blair defiant over nuclear plans, Thursday, 15 February.

First, sustainable development as a highly normative, yet extremely vague concept inescapably raises issues of governance and political steering. Second, the many contributions, approaching sustainability governance from multiple angles, have in common that they assume sustainability goals to a certain extent as given. Third, sustainability poses specific challenges to governance that are different from other policy fields. In this context, exiting contributions highlight issues of complexity, uncertainty or ambivalence, albeit in a rather cursory manner. Against this background, a specific approach is introduced, exploring the complexities that arise from limits to rational steering in three dimensions: Sustainability goals are ambivalent in that they are subject to controversies based on heterogeneous perceptions, values and interests of individuals and societal groups. Moreover, the knowledge of the complex dynamics involving society, technology and nature typically remains highly uncertain. Finally, the power to shape structural change in society and technology is distributed across a multitude of actors and societal subsystems. The article concludes by outlining the structure of the present collection of papers and by summarising each contribution. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Complexity; Innovations; Participation; Policy; Political steering; Reflexive governance; Socio-technical transitions",,,,,,,"Bäckstrand, K., Civic Science for Sustainability: Reframing the Role of Experts, Policy-Makers and Citizens in Environmental Governance (2003) Global Environmental Politics, 3 (4), pp. 24-41; Bäckstrand, K., Democratizing Global Environmental Governance?

Achterburgwal 237, 1012 DC Amsterdam, Netherlands","How does steering for sustainability work within the world of contemporary politics, where roles are increasingly ambiguous and power dispersed? This paper explores this question empirically by studying the practice of reflexive governance - a mode of steering that encourages actors to scrutinize and reconsider their underlying assumptions, institutional arrangements and practices. The practice of reflexive governance has been conceptualized in various ways: as a strategic process of opening up and closing down, as a state-led activity of facilitating socio-technological transitions, and as a mode of network co-ordination to promote system innovation. What all these accounts underplay is the political context of reflexive processes, and the politics that they generate. This paper offers an alternative conceptualization of reflexive governance that situates sites of reflexivity within a broader discursive system composed of multiple arenas, actors and forms of political communication. Applying this framework to a Dutch case study reveals a host of struggles involved in enacting reflexive governance, particularly as actors try to reconcile the demands of reflexivity (being open, self-critical and creative) with the demands of their existing political world (closed preferences, agenda driven, control). The analysis sheds light on the work - and indeed politics - involved in legitimizing more reflexive modes of governing for sustainability. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Democracy; Governance; Power; Reflexive modernization; Reflexivity; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Systems innovation; Transition management",,,,,,,"Alexander, J.C., (1995) Fin de Siècle Social Theory.

A process of deliberation and change was started - aimed at achieving 'transitions' - using a model of transition management. This paper examines how the new arrangements of governance for energy transition deal with six problems of steering: ambivalence about goals, uncertainty about cause-effect relations, distributed power of control, political myopia, determination of short-term steps for long-term change and the danger of lock-in to new systems. The Dutch experience shows that transition management is applied in ways different from the original model (established players play a too great role) but it appears a useful model of reflexive governance, combining advantages of incremental politics with those of planning. It helps to orientate innovation policy and sectoral policies to sustainable development goals and to exploit business interests in system innovations in a prudent manner. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Energy transition; Governance; Sustainable development; Transition management",,,,,,,"Arthur, W.B., Competing Technologies, Increasing Returns, and Lock-in By Historical Events (1989) Economic Journal, 99, pp. 116-131; Beck, U., The Reinvention of Politics: Towards a Theory of Reflexive Modernization (1994) Reflexive Modernization, pp. 1-55. , U.

This is one of the causes of environmental degradation in coastal zones. The Patos Lagoon Estuary, located along the southern coast of Brazil, has accumulated environmental liabilities over the last 30 years due to socioeconomic activities in the city of Rio Grande. These liabilities are particularly conspicuous in the shallow estu-arine embayments, which are considered vital habitats due to their high productivity and significance as nurseries (shelter and feeding) for the local biota. Since the 1970s, these habitats have suffered various stressors from uncontrolled urban and industrial expansion, which are responsible for landfills at the estuary shores and the enrichment of the water with nutrients and metals from the disposal of effluents. In the medium to long term, these problems tend to be aggravated by existing projects and policies of industrial and port expansion. One of the most productive environments in this estuary is Mangueira Bay, an oval semi-enclosed bay located south of the city with an area of 23 km2 and a depth mostly below 1.5 m. This embayment is currently a focus of land/water use conflicts involving several social actors, including fishermen, socially excluded people, high-class housing users, public institutions, industries and the general population. In this context, finding a solution that is appropriate and compatible with all social demands on the environmental goods and services provided by the estuary is a difficult task. The process must begin with a technical diagnosis that is extensive and detailed enough to include social, economic and environmental issues. This paper describes the use conflicts of Mangueira Bay and suggests guidelines for a collective management plan.","Patos Lagoon Estuary; Sustainable development coastal management",,,,,,,"Asmus, M.L., Pradarias de gramineas niarinhas (Ruppia mar-itima) como áreas vitais na região estuarial da Lagoa dos Patos (1989) Proc.

In Western Europe, standards were set for mercury emissions from chlor-alkali plants, which were gradually tightened subsequently. Research and development (R&D) efforts were directed to end-of-pipe technologies as well as process improvements for reducing mercury emissions, rather than to clean technologies, which eliminate mercury from within the production process. With a significant reduction in mercury emissions with end-of-pipe technologies, new plants continued to be built that relied on the mercury process. As long as these relatively new plants could be utilized, technological transition to the clean ion-exchange membrane process remained slow. The success in reducing mercury emissions with end-of-pipe technologies, in effect, helped to prolong the lifetime of the existing mercury process. In Japan, the government introduced policies to phase out the existing mercury process. The strict approach encouraged innovative companies to make R&D efforts on clean technologies, instead of end-of-pipe technologies for pollution abatement. Applied in a hasty and inflexible way, however, the stringent regulation initially induced most of the chloralkali producers to choose the diaphragm process, which later turned out to be inappropriate. After the regulatory schedule was modified to allow more time for process conversion, the remaining mercury-based plants were converted directly to the most efficient ion-exchange membrane process. The technological transition, however, was costly, as most of the diaphragm-based plants introduced following the regulatory mandate were operated only for a short period of time, with the large investment wasted. © 2007 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University.","Diaphragm; Industrial ecology; Institution; Ion-exchange membrane; Mercury; Research and development (R&D)","Diaphragms; Environmental regulations; Ion exchange membranes; Pollution control; Research and development management; Standards; Chlor-alkali plants; Industrial ecology; Mercury emissions; Chemical industry; emission control; environmental policy; industrial emission; innovation; ion exchange; mercury (element); pollution control; standard (regulation); technological change; Asia; Eurasia; Europe; Far East; Japan",,,,,,"(1998) Chemicals and long-term economic growth: Insights from the chemical industry, , Arora, A, R.

We use the energy-systems optimization model MESSAGE to construct several climate change mitigation scenarios with various levels of regional participation in short-to-mid term. By comparing these with a global scenario that assumes full spatial and temporal flexibility throughout the century, we are able to evaluate how participatory decisions affect the mitigation response as well as the costs and technology choices. We find that short-term postponement of participation from some regions can often lead to a delay of mitigation measures on the global level. However, if the regional delay lasts until mid-century, participants of the regime are likely to increase their efforts in the short term. Mitigation costs are found to substantially increase as a result of delayed participation-the extent of the increase depends on the relative importance of the region that postpones its participation, the stringency of the climate target and the ability to reorganize mitigation measures. Our analysis also shows that a region's decision to delay its participation in an international climate regime can lead to accumulated inertia in its energy system and thus to a delayed 'technological transition' toward a low-carbon future. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This article uses the term transition to indicate that sustainable technology development not only involves technological changes, but also changes in social and cultural dimensions. The direction and speed of transitions are determined largely by the collective innovation decisions of various actors involved. This article focuses on uncertainties from an actor-perspective, since the uncertainties perceived by the actors involved will influence their decisions greatly. Special attention is given to the entrepreneurs: business firms involved in developing and implementing technological innovation. By examining two empirical cases of emerging sustainable energy technologies in the Netherlands (micro-CHP and biofuels), we demonstrate which types of perceived uncertainties influence the innovation decisions of the actors involved and how these actors respond to perceived uncertainties. Uncertainty about government policy was dominant in both cases. Comparison of both case studies shows that uncertainties have a greater negative effect on innovation decisions when the time-to-market is smaller. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Perceived uncertainty; Sustainable energy technology; Technological innovation; Transition management","Chandipura virus",,,,,,"ANP (1993) Bukman sceptisch over kansen bio-brandstof, ANP, 27 MayANP (1994) Europese subsidie voor Rotterdamse verkeersprojecten, ANP, 24 February(1996), ANP () Van Aartsen wil fiscale steun bio-ethanolproject, ANP, 15 MarchANP (1997) Nedalco is wachten op accijnsvrijstelling bio-ethanol zat, ANP, 4 FebruaryBizz (2002) De Oliemolen (2), Bizz, 15 NovemberCorrêa, H.L., (1994) Linking Flexibility, Uncertainty and Variability in Manufacturing Systems: Managing un-planned change in the automtative industry, , Aldershot: Avebury; Dess, G.G., Beard, D.W., Dimensions of Organizational Task Environments (1984) Administrative Science Quarterly, 29 (1), pp. 52-73; Volkskrant, D., Snelle olie uit hout (1998) De Volkskrant, , 24 January; Duurzame Energie (1997) Nedalco start commerciële productie bio-ethanol, Duurzame Energie, AugustElzen, B., Geels, F., Green, K., (2004) System Innovation and the Transition to Sustainability.

However, the manner in which most transitions are implemented runs counter to research findings on the process of effective change management and, in particular, disregards the natural process of human adaptation. As a result, mismanaged transitions tend to have negative consequences for organizations and their members. Ironically, the characteristic of transitions that prompts individual and organizational strife - the capacity to disrupt the status quo - also enables an opportunity for individual and organizational renewal. For that to occur, however, members must make progress through the natural process of adaptation. This paper aims to propose a framework for facilitating adaptation to organizational transition, to both overcome the undesirable consequences of transitions and to accelerate achievement of the transition's strategic objectives. Design/methodology/ approach - This is a conceptual paper based on a review of the literatures on adaptation and transition and the author's own experience as a researcher or consultant in over 100 major organizational transitions. Findings - The framework presented here should contribute to both the practice of organizational change management and empirical studies of interventions to facilitate individual adaptation to major organizational transitions. Originality/value - The framework introduced in this paper should have a direct and substantial impact on transition management, employee well being and organizational effectiveness. It should minimize the negative consequences of transitions and accelerate the process of adaptation to organizational transition. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Acquisitions and mergers; Downsizing; Transition management",,,,,,,"Bass, B., (1985) Leadership and Performance beyond Expectations, , The Free Press New York, NY; Bommer, W.H., Rich, G.A., Rubin, R.S., Changing attitudes about change: Longitudinal effects of transformational leader behavior on employee cynicism about organizational change (2005) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 26, pp. 733-53; Bridges, W., (1991) Managing Transitions, , Addison-Wesley Reading, MA; Brockner, J., Managing the effects of layoffs on survivors (1992) California Management Review, 34, pp. 9-28; Buch, K., Aldridge, J., OD under conditions of organizational decline (1991) Organization Development Journal, 9, pp. 1-5; Burke, R.J., Organizational transitions (2002) The New World of Work, , Cooper, C.L.

As the technology is assimilated, the changes in the relationship between the employer and employee are morphing requiring more trust, more communication, and a major change in the supervisory thinking and function. This adoption leads to cost reductions for the organization, a required 24-7 mentality for the employee, and the realization that while the physical strings have been cut, the wireless strings that bind the relationship between employer and employee are tighter than ever. The paper presents a model that includes a set of organizational processes that may reduce individual resistance, facilitate technological transition, and result in a greater understanding of the technology assimilation process. © Copyright (c) by The Haworth Press, Inc.

To explore the experiences of the health service provision in the transition process from childhood to adult life from the perspective of young patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and health professionals working in this field. Method. Two groups of young persons with JIA and two groups of health professionals were interviewed in focus groups. The data were analysed according to approved guidelines for qualitative analysis. Results. 'Capability to lead a meaningful adult life' emerged as a core category; capability as a consequence of 'being enabled' from the youths' point of view, and 'enabling the young patients' from the health professionals' perspective. Preparation for the transition and transfer process was perceived as inadequate and seemed dependent on enthusiastic health professionals both in the children's and adult wards. Suggestions for formal improvements were required in four main areas. Conclusion. This pilot study has identified in adequacies in the transition management provided for young people with JIA. Acceptance of the young persons as active participants in their own transition process might strengthen these young persons' experience of an autonomous identity and enable participation socially and in society, thus enhancing the ability to achieve a meaningful adult life. Further investigations should focus on adults living with JIA, how they lead their lives physically and psychosocially.","Adolescent; Adult; Empowerment; Juvenile idiopathic arthritis; Transition","adolescent; adult; adulthood; article; childhood; clinical article; controlled study; empowerment; female; health personnel attitude; health practitioner; human; interview; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; male; Norway; patient attitude; patient autonomy; physical performance; pilot study; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quality of life; social interaction; social psychology; daily life activity; information processing; personal autonomy; psychological aspect; Activities of Daily Living; Adolescent; Adult; Arthritis, Juvenile Rheumatoid; Attitude of Health Personnel; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Interviews; Male; Norway; Personal Autonomy; Pilot Projects; Quality of Life",,,,,,"McDonagh, J., Foster, H.E., Hall, M.A., Chamberlain, M.A., Audit of rheumatology services for adolescents and young adults in the UK.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors posit that as the psychological contract between employers and employees undergoes a metamorphosis reflecting the fundamental changes in the exchange of work and rewards, human resource professionals would be well served to include a counseling approach to employee communication. Findings - The authors suggest that the counseling model will support a culture of transparency and yield positive outcomes for all concerned. Research limitations/implications - The co-authors relied on their research and own experience in the field of human resource management and student counseling to develop this paper. The suggested model needs to be subjected to the rigors of academic scrutiny before it can be applied. The implications for human resource professionals are important as any tool to help further assist in the organization's staffing efforts, specifically retention of knowledge workers, as well as providing support to the overall success of the organization. Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in the interdisciplinary approach of combining some basic tenets of the counseling field with the human resource management function in the organization.","Contracts of employment; Counselling; Human resource management; Transition management",,,,,,,"Arthur, M.B., ""The boundaryless career: A new perspective for organizational inquiry"" (1994) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 15 (4), pp. 295-306; Baruch, Y., ""Integrated career systems for the 2000s"" (1999) International Journal of Manpower, 20 (7), pp. 432-457; Baruch, Y., ""Transforming careers: From linear to multidirectional career paths - Organizational and individual perspectives"" (2004) Career Development International, 9 (1), pp. 58-73; Bohart, A., Greenberg, L., ""Empathy and psychotherapy: An introductory overview"" (1997) Empathy Reconsidered, pp. 3-32. , in Bohart, A. and Greenberg, L.

However, no relocation self-efficacy instrument is available. Objectives: To develop and test an instrument measuring older adults' self-efficacy to relocate to an ILC. METHOD:: A 101-item initial instrument representing facets of relocation self-efficacy was developed based on the literature on self-efficacy and relocation and on qualitative interviews with a sample of women who had relocated to ILCs. The instrument was content validated by a panel of experts, reduced to 65 items, and then evaluated by a convenience sample of 166 community-dwelling older adults who planned to move to an ILC. The sample ranged in age from 65 to 91 years (M ≤ 76.59 years, SD ≤ 6.02 years); most were female (63%), Caucasian (96%), college educated (59%), and married (62%). Assessment of the scale included calculation of internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, item and scale correlation coefficients, and principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation to evaluate construct validity, scale structure, and item response range. In addition, convergent validity of the Self-Efficacy Relocation Scale (SERS) was evaluated by assessing correlations with measures of positive relationships (Positive Relations With Others Scale) and environmental mastery (Environmental Mastery Scale). Results: The final SERS consists of 32 items in three factors: Engagement Efficacy, Daily Living Efficacy, and Transition Management Efficacy. These three factors explained 68% of the sample variance. Cronbach's ± for the total scale was .97; ± for the three factors was .96, .96, and .91, respectively. As anticipated, convergent validity was supported by moderate positive correlations between the three SERS factors and the Positive Relations With Others Scale and Environmental Mastery Scale. Discussion: Identifying older adults at risk for difficulty in adjusting to relocation prior to moving to an ILC by using a measure of relocation self-efficacy has important implications for their health and life satisfaction. This study suggests that the SERS may be useful in identifying such individuals and alerting healthcare professionals to initiate early interventions to facilitate positive relocation adjustment. Further testing of the SERS with heterogeneous socioeconomic, marital, ethnic, and racial samples is needed.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey of the top 500 Australian organizations and two in-depth case studies of two Australian public-sector organizations were conducted. Findings - Several key issues for IS/IT outsourcing were identified - problems in evaluating outsourcing contracts, embedded contract mentality, ability to manage contracts, and staff transition management. Practical implications - Outsourcing organizations need to implement changes carefully and assess their in-house capabilities. They also need to fully understand and apply the IS/IT investment evaluation and benefits realization processes. In order to reach the magnitude of improvements ascribed to IS/IT outsourcing organizations need to undertake proper risk assessment and effectively manage outsourcing relationships. These all have to be done before and during the vendor/technology selection assessment and contract negotiation process. Originality/value - IS/IT outsourcing in the public sector is particularly under-studied. This study identifies several key issues for organizations undertaking IS/IT outsourcing. Recommendations are provided to assist outsourcing organizations in dealing with these issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Communication technologies; Information systems; Outsourcing; Public sector organizations",,,,,,,"Allen, D., Kern, T., Mattison, D., Culture, power and politics in ICT outsourcing in higher education institutions (2002) European Journal of Information Systems, 11, pp. 159-73; Anderson, J., Van Crowder, L., The present and future of public sector extension in Africa: Contracting out or contracting in?

Design/methodology/approach - Two different empirical procedures are applied by estimating the technology convergence within the European Union on Eurostat data set. The first is framework developed by Dowrick and Nguyen. The second one is the authors' original contribution to the methodology which is based on the frontier production functions. Findings - Significant technology convergence is recognized between 15 old EU-member states and eight new-member states. However, the technology convergence has obviously not accelerated the convergence of gross domestic product per labor unit between exposed groups of economies. Technical inefficiency is recognized as the main source that impedes a spill-over effect of technology convergence. Following this it is established that in the future more effort should be directed into elimination of technical inefficiency. Originality/value - Presented findings can be used to arrange the economic policy measures aimed at accelerating technology development in case of European Union. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic performance;

We describe that the emergence of a new innovation system and changes in existing innovation systems co-evolve with the process of technological change. Therefore, it is necessary to create more insight in the dynamics of innovation systems. Traditional methods of innovation system analysis that mainly focus on the structure of innovation systems have proven to be insufficient. Therefore, we propose a framework that focuses on a number of processes that are highly important for well performing innovation systems. These processes are labeled as 'functions of innovation systems'. After explaining this framework and embedding it in existing literature, we propose a method for systematically mapping those processes taking place in innovation systems and resulting in technological change. This method can be characterized as a process analysis or history event analysis. Clarifying examples are taken from the empirical field of Sustainable Technology Development. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In the biomedical field, however, end-user participation in decision-making is rare. Some scholars argue that because patients are stakeholders and relevant experts, they could also provide important contributions to decision-making within the field of biomedical research. But what strategies could be used to effectively implement patient participation in decision-making on biomedical research? In this article, we analyze strategies for patient participation and conclude that these can hardly be regarded effective because they do not ensure patients' structural influence on decision-making. We identify obstacles for effective patient participation, which seem to reflect a resilience of the current biomedical decision-making network. We subsequently elaborate on the concept of transition management in the search for clues on how to breach this resilience and change the network toward the inclusion of patients. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Biomedical research; Patient involvement; Socio-technical networks; Transition management; User participation",,,,,,,"Abelson, J., Forest, P.-G., Eyles, J., Smith, P., Martin, E., Gauvin, F.-P., Deliberations about deliberative methods: Issues in the design and evaluation of public participation processes (2003) Social Science & Medicine, 57 (2), pp. 239-251; (2002) Research Newsletter: Quality Research in Dementia Newsletter of the Alzheimer's Society, , Alzheimer's Society.

History teaches us that as soon as technological transitions proved successful, the government sooner or later got involved with the distribution. This article aims to answer two questions, namely, (1) how do governmental bodies use legal instruments in the control, stimulation and accommodation of technological change, and (2) what effects do legal instruments have on the operation of innovative private entrepreneurs. Effects on private innovators are qualified as positive, neutral or negative. The research method chosen has been inspired by insights from legal sociology, the public choice theory and strategic actor behaviour in qualitative simulation-games, but follows distinct methodological steps. Throughout the article, a case study on the transition from telegraphy to telephony in The Netherlands will be used to illustrate the discussion.

First, it uses criticisms on the multi-level perspective as stepping stones for further conceptual refinements. Second, it develops a typology of four transition pathways: transformation, reconfiguration, technological substitution, and de-alignment and re-alignment. These pathways differ in combinations of timing and nature of multi-level interactions. They are illustrated with historical examples. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - This is an inductive, interpretative case study complimented by hands-on experience with the industry. Findings - The paper finds that Huawei lies at a crossroads in a transitional telecommunication sector that is no longer isolated from global reforms and advancement. Through internationalisation the company has learned to compete by adjusting their mechanisms, learning instruments and focus. Originality/value - The paper is useful for practitioners in that it shows how indigenous companies in latecomer industrialising countries like China can overcome the late mover position in some of the advanced markets they have entered.

In this article we present a practical model for managing processes of co-evolution: transition management. Transition management is a multilevel model of governance which shapes processes of co-evolution using visions, transition experiments and cycles of learning and adaptation. Transition management helps societies to transform themselves in a gradual, reflexive way through guided processes of variation and selection, the outcomes of which are stepping stones for further change. It shows that societies can break free from existing practices and technologies, by engaging in co-evolutionary steering. This is illustrated by the Dutch waste management transition. Perhaps transition management constitutes the third way that policy scientists have been looking for all the time, combining the advantages of incrementalism (based on mutual adaptation) with the advantages of planning (based on long-term objectives).","And goal-oriented modulation; Co-evolution; Incrementalism; Multi-level governance; Planning; Sustainable development","adaptation; coevolution; learning; planning method; selection; social change; sustainable development; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; Western Europe",,,,,,"Beck, U., The Reinvention of Politics.

We will illustrate this by showing how perceptions of the water-problems in the Netherlands have shifted in the past four decades. The nature of water-related problems changed from a technical problem to a so-called 'persistent' problem, characterized by plurality, uncertainty and complexity. Although integrated water resource management (IWRM) has been advocated to cope with this type of problem, the complexity of the transition process towards such a water management regime is often underestimated. Therefore, transition management is needed in the water sector. Transition management theory is presented and applied to the Dutch case. Transition management strategies are suggested that would reinforce this transition. Comparison between the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and transition management indicates that the Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) in its current form is not sufficiently stimulating an innovation climate. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","European Water Framework Directive (WFD); Integrated water resource management (IRWM); Transition management","Water resources; Integrated water resource management; Transition management; Water framework directive; Management; Management; Water resources; environmental policy; integrated approach; policy implementation; strategic approach; water management; water resource; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; Western Europe",,,,,,"Arthur, B.W., Competing technologies (1988) Technological Change and Economic Development, , In: Dosi G (ed) Printer, London/New York; Berkhout, F., Smith, A., en Stirling, A., (2003) Socio-technical Regimes and Transitions Contexts, , SPRU Electronic Working Paper Series; Bosch, A., Ham, Wvd., (1998) Twee Eeuwen Rijkswaterstaat, 1798-1990.

Using Cultural Theory as a heuristic, this paper presents four archetypical approaches to transition management. The fatalist approach refrains from transition management (motto: 'First, disaster must happen'). The system is in a stalemate that no experiment or hierarchy can break; external events must bring the window of opportunity for change. The hierarchic approach relies on a dominant actor coalition to steer change (motto: 'Let's put a man on the moon!'). The individualist approach relies mainly on changing the financial ground rules (motto: 'Sustainability through the market'). Finally, the egalitarian approach relies on process management, doing experiments, etc. (motto: 'A good transition arena will solve it all'). This approach makes sense if the situation is not clear enough to be managed via one of the other approaches, and there is a clearly identifiable learning objective. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Inspired by Barnett the paper also asks: What is it to learn for an unknown future? According to Bartlett neither knowledge nor skills are sufficient to enable success in the contemporary world. What is needed are certain kinds of human qualities and dispositions. The paper seeks to introduce two examples that help us to analyse the phenomenon from the perspectives of higher education and working life. Design/methodology/approach - The data consists of an interview on pedagogical practices in actor training and of group mentoring discussions in a teacher community. Findings - Based on the observations, the educational process itself with its disturbing factors, the transition to working life, and finding one's place in it are all sites that provide their own challenges for an unknown future. The contradiction between security and the unknown inscribed in them produces uncertainty. Furthermore, the paper maintains that self-challenge is one of the dispositions needed for living with uncertainty. Originality/value - Dialogic mentoring is a tool by which the problems and contradictions raised by daily practices can be challenged. Some of these contradictions may have their roots in unsolved challenges during education, and then have to be shouldered by the work community. The concept of dialogic mentoring is a fruitful pedagogical tool in preventing and reducing work-based stress and exhaustion experienced by newcomers in work communities.","Finland; Mentoring; Transition management; Workplace learning",,,,,,,"Barnett, R., ""Learning for an unknown future"" (2004) Higher Education Research and Development, 23 (3), pp. 247-260; Barnett, R., ""Recapturing the universal in the university"" (2005) Educational Philosophy and Theory, 37 (6), pp. 785-797; Becher, T., Trowler, P.R., (2001) Academic Tribes and Territories: Intellectual Inquiry and the Cultures of Disciplines, , Society for Research in Higher Education Ballmoor; Bell, S.E., ""Becoming a political woman: The reconstruction and interpretation of experience through stories"" (1988) Gender and Discourse: The Power of Talk, , in Dundas Todd, A. and Fisher, S.

This paper provides a brief review of power sector reform efforts in five South Asian countries and uses an institutional economics framework to identify the factors shaping the success of power sector reforms. Four factors, namely instability of rule-makers, poor overall acceptance, slow adaptation and poor transition management are identified and their effect on the reform process of South Asia are analysed. The paper finds that political instability has affected the power sector reform of the region, making hard decisions difficult to take. Slow progress of reform has also affected the sector viability, as signs of adverse effects on the power sector investment and performance are already visible. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To explore and describe eating attitudes in early pubertal 11-year-old black and white South African girls in an urban environment undergoing transition. Design. The study was designed as a cross-sectional baseline initiative within a longitudinal study. Subjects. Two hundred and two subjects were randomly selected; 54 were white and 148 black. Methods. Subjects completed questionnaires, and anthropometric measurements were taken. Outcome measures. Variables included body mass index (BMI), eating attitudes (EAT score), dietary intake, socio-economic status, pubertal status and level of physical activity. Results. As expected, the prevalence rate of abnormal eating attitudes in this group of girls was low (1%). No significant ethnic differences were found in the total EAT scores. White participants displayed greater oral control, while their black peers displayed greater tendencies toward dieting (p = 0.05). Girls who scored higher on the dieting subscale had a larger body size and were more inactive than low dieting scorers (p = 0.05). A relationship between body size measurements and dietary intake was found only in black girls. Traditionally a larger figure is accepted in black culture. However our data suggest a move away from this, indicating acculturation, as awareness of increased body size significantly influenced dieting attitudes. However, scores were within the normal range. Conclusions. There is early evidence suggesting the impact of societal transition on young black girls with regard to eating attitudes. Black girls in this age group are adopting Western ideals of beauty and thinness.",,"anthropometry; article; body mass; body size; controlled study; cultural factor; eating habit; ethnic difference; female; food intake; human; longitudinal study; Negro; phase transition; physical activity; prevalence; puberty; questionnaire; school child; social aspect; social status; South Africa; urban area; Western Hemisphere",,,,,,"Whitaker, A.H., An epidemiological study of anorexic and bulimic symptoms in adolescent girls: Implications for paediatricians (1992) Perdiatr Ann, 21, pp. 752-759; Lucas, A.R., The eating disorder 'epidemic': More apparent than real?

We characterize the solution to the textbook Hotelling model when there is a ceiling on the stock of emissions. We consider both increasing and decreasing demand for energy. We show that when the ceiling is binding, both the low-cost nonrenewable resource and the high-cost renewable resource may be used jointly. A key implication is that if energy demand were to decline in the long run, we may supplement energy supply through 'clean' renewables to meet the environmental standard, but then revert back to using only 'dirty' fossil fuels in the future when the ceiling has become non-binding. That is, the much heralded societal 'transition' to clean energy resources may be short-lived. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The problem for policy is how to promote economic growth while reducing environmental impacts. The response of society, so far, is inadequate to solve these problems. Dramatic reduction in emissions, are necessary. Most policy analysis does not consider dramatic changes. An important aspect of the limited time horizon of analysis and policy is that there are few plausible and specific visions of very-low-emission transport systems. Directed processes of change - transitions - to new forms of transport are required, in terms of transport systems, the structure of the built environment and lifestyles, and culture. It requires the consideration of how to initiate social and economic processes that will transform transportation. Policy must provide the direction and processes while realising that the ability to control outcomes in detail is limited. The literature on technology transitions is helpful here. The transportation-demand-management (TDM) literature shows how to change behaviour, in particular the need for packages of mutually supporting actions and policies. The literature on sustainable consumption also has useful ideas for strategies to effect behavioural change, similar in some respects to the technological-transitions literature. © Crown Copyright 2006.",,"Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Motor transportation; Social sciences; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Economic growth; Sustainable consumption; Transportation-demand-management (TDM); Public policy",,,,,,"Goetz, A.R., Graham, B., Air transport globalization, liberalization and sustainability: Post-2001 policy dynamics in the United States and Europe (2004) Journal of Transport Geography, 12, pp. 265-276; Schipper, L.J., Fulton, L., Carbon dioxide emissions from transportation: Trends, driving factors, and forces for change (2003) Hensher and Button, pp. 203-226. , Eds, Elsevier, Amsterdam; Stopher, P.R., History of environmental legislation (2003) Handbook of transport and the environment, pp. 497-514. , Hensher and Button Eds, Elsevier, Amsterdam; Geels, F.W., (2002) Understanding the dynamics of technological transitions: A co-evolutionary and socio-technical analysis, , Twente University Press; (2003) Our energy future - creating a low carbon economy, , Department of Trade and Industry DTI, The Stationery Office, London; (2003) The future of air transport, , Department for Transport DIT, The Stationery Office; Halcrow, Year 2000 CO2 Forecasts (2002) Halcrow Technical Note 6th October 2002 quoted in DfT; (2003) Handbook of transport and the environment, , Hensher, D.A, and Button, K.J, Eds, Elsevier; Badland, H., Schofield, G., Transport, urban design, and physical activity: An evidence-based update (2005) Transportation Research Part D, 10, pp. 177-196; Handy, S., Amenity and Severance (2003) Handbook of transport and the environment, , Hensher, D.A, and Button, K.J, Eds; Mackie, P., Nellthorp, J., Cost benefit analysis (2001) Handbook of transport systems and traffic control, pp. 143-174. , Hensher D.

The technique is based on power side energy source to self-supply the transistors. AC-AC MOS controlled converters are well known for their complex practical Implementation due to numerous transistor use with numerous potential references. This requires many gate drivers and gate driver supplies. In addition, the MOS-MOS switching transition that takes place in this kind of converter is complex to manage and leads often to over voltages or over currents. The presented gate driver powering technique allows to simplify both, the global implementation of the converter and the MOS-MOS switching transition management. The self-powering technique simplifies the implementation and the technique can be fully integrated with the power switch to be controlled. This leads to a cost effective solutions. In addition, the very specific operation of the self powering technique is used to simplify switching transitions. In fact, the gate driver power supplies are sensitive to dv/dt and this is used to perform self powering during dead time switching transitions, leading to minimum dead time duration and reduced over voltages. The paper recalls at first how the self powering technique operates. Then, MOS controlled AC switch configurations are discussed with respect to monolithic integration issues. Then, the operation of a single phase AC-AC MOS controlled converter with self-powering technique and dead time management is presented. The very specific operation during switching transitions is underlined. A final part of the paper is dedicated to practical validation with numerous practical results and explanation. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Chlorine compounds; Cost effectiveness; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electronics industry; Industrial electronics; Management; Monolithic integrated circuits; Switches; Switching; Three term control systems; Time switches; Transistors; AC switches; AND gates; Annual conference; Cost-effective solutions; Dead time; Energy sourcing; Fully integrated; Gate drivers; Global implementation; Monolithic integrations; Over currents; Over voltages; Power supplies; Power switching; Practical implementation; Self powering; Single phasing; Switching transitions; Automobile drivers",,,,,,"B.D.

The approaches employed address properly the challenges found in typical outdoor scenes such as localised and global lighting changes, variations in object size and views, occlusions, and complex object motion and so on. The contributions include use of an effective two-layer shadow removal scheme based on brightness distortion in different colour channels, blob-based object tracking and occlusion handling via multi-state transition management. The system works equally well on highly compressed (JPEG + MPEG-4) video streams as well as raw video data; in the former case, it achieves about 18 frames per second with software MPEG-4 decoder in a modern PC.

The purpose of this research is to find those factors, which significantly contribute to the innovativeness of organizations in the oldest market-based economies but they have not been developed in the transition organizations. Design/methodology/approach - A range of recently published works, which aimed to provide different theoretical findings and best practice of innovative economies highlighted organizational culture, entrepreneurship and market orientation as the most important factors influencing the organizational innovation intensity and sustained competitive advantage. These factors and their relationships together with the characteristics of the transition economies were applied to put hypotheses about their impact on innovation intensity in the transition organizations. The structural equation modeling was used to test these hypotheses on the sample of 214 Slovenian organizations. Findings - The comparison of both innovation models, i.e. one significant for the innovative organizations, and the other found for the transition organizations showed that innovative organizational culture and market orientation have been the most important missing factors preventing the transition organizations from being innovative and thus achieving the sustained competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications - Data collection was limited to one country, i.e. Slovenia. Practical implications - The results obtained show that organizations cannot be innovative if all the most important factors influencing the innovation capability are not equally developed. Originality/value - The missing factors and relations which have been the main obstacles for the transition organizations to be more innovative are found by benchmarking based on the structural equation modeling. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competitive advantage; Cybernetics; Innovation; Transition management",,,,,,,"Ahmed, P.K., Culture and climate for innovation (1998) European Journal of Innovation Management, 1 (1), pp. 30-43; Antoncic, B., Hisrich, R.D., Corporate entrepreneurship contingencies and organizational wealth creation (2004) Journal of Management Development, 23 (6), pp. 518-55; Baggozi, R.P., Foxall, G.R., Construct validation of a measure of adaptive-innovative cognitive styles in consumption (1996) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 13 (3), pp. 201-13; Bastic, M., Success factors in transition countries (2004) European Journal of Innovation Management, (1), pp. 65-79; Bentler, P.M., Comparative fit indexes in structural models (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107 (2), pp. 238-46; Bolwijn, P.T., Kumpe, T., Manufacturing in the 1990s-productivity, flexibility and innovation (1990) Long Range Planning, 23 (4), pp. 44-57; Bucar, M., Stare, M., Slovenian innovation policy: Underexploited potential for growth (2002) Journal of International Relations and Development, 5 (4), pp. 427-48; Covin, J.G., Slevin, D.P., Strategic management of small firms in hostile and benign environments (1989) Strategic Management Journal, 10, pp. 75-87; D'Aveni, R.K., (1994) Hyper-competition - Managing the Dynamics of Strategic Maneuvering, , The Free Press New York, NY; Day, G.S., Continuous learning about markets (1994) California Management Review, 36, pp. 9-31; Day, G.S., Wensley, R., Assessing advantage; A framework for diagnosing competitive superiority (1988) Journal of Marketing, 52, pp. 1-20; Despande, R., Webster Jr., F.E., Organizational culture and marketing: Defining the research agenda (1989) Journal of Marketing, 53, pp. 3-15; Drucker, P.F., (1994) Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Practice and Principles, , Heinemann London; (2004) Innovation in Europe: Public Consultation, , European Commision, available at: www.europa.eu.int/comm/eurostat/; Gaski, J., Theory of power and conflict in channels of distribution (1984) Journal of Marketing, 48, pp. 9-29; Gerbing, D.W., Anderson, J.C., An updated paradigm for scale development incorporating unidimensionality and its assessment (1988) Journal of Marketing Research, 25, pp. 186-92; Hair, J.F., Anderson, R.E., Tatham, R.L., Black, W.C., (1995) Multivariate Data Analysis with Readings, , Prentice-Hall Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Hisrich, R.D., Peters, M.P., (1998) Entrepreneurship: Starting, Developing, and Managing A New Enterprise, , 4th ed.

Design/methodology/approach - Comparative literature review based on transition management and scenario development. Research limitations/ implications - Need of further systemic thought about the required criteria of transition scenarios and the embedding of scenario use in transition management processes. Practical implications - Processes of transition management are in need of transition specific scenarios. Originality/value - Because transition management implies a complex and long-term steering paradigm with which current scenario applications are not familiar, conclusions are drawn on the (changing) requirements of scenario development processes in transition management and on the need to innovate current scenario methods in the context of transition management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Sustainable development; Transition management",,,,,,,"(2003) Op Hete Kolen.

Transitions typically increase transaction costs and tracking error beyond the risk of the normal investment processes, and both transaction costs and tracking error have a significant influence on performance. Suggested here is a model to deal more systematically with transition issues that is independent of the trigger of the transition (such as a rebalancing strategy). The model is less complex than others suggested so far and is well-suited to deal with multiple assets.

To successfully cope with this complexity requires transition management. Integrated approaches for supporting sustainability transitions have been elaborated in the last years. Future studies and scenario construction are regarded as essential components in these approaches. However, the related studies in this field have focused either on a specific type of transition process, or on decision support in a different contextual process, or on a specific function of scenarios. Thus, an evaluation of the wide range of viewpoints on the functions of scenarios with respect to the requirements for transition management is still missing. In this paper, we systematically elaborate upon the functions for transition management that scenarios can fulfil. The developed concept is applied to five empirical scenario studies supporting transition processes on the national, regional and local level in Switzerland. The paper contributes to the development of a functional methodology of transition support, providing initial guidelines for answering the question of which method is appropriate for what type and phase of a transition process. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Sustainability entrepreneurs are increasingly seen as being in the vanguard of a shift to a new form of capitalist development that can help to address fears over global warming, climate change and their associated negative environmental impacts. Such developments can be set within a wider popular and academic discourse of ecological modernisation, at the heart of which is a relatively optimistic view of the potential for technological change to lead to solutions for environmental problems. This paper focuses on a subset of sustainable entrepreneurs termed 'ecopreneurs' who seek to combine business practice with sustainable development and so transform their business sectors. The paper suggests that work on sustainable entrepreneurship could be substantially improved by an engagement with the literature on transition management in science and technology studies and makes some suggestions as to how such a research agenda could be advanced.",,,,,,,,"Angel, D., Environmental Innovation and Regulation (2000) The Oxford Handbook of Economic Geography, pp. 607-622. , G.L.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper reveals the historical roots of case studies, transdisciplinarity and sustainable development as teaching and research paradigms. The TCS approach is presented, which has been developed at ETH for supporting transition management of regional, urban, and organizational systems. This approach is entrenched by an ontology that reveals the basic characteristics of ill-defined transition problems, an epistemology that refers to Probabilistic Functionalism and distinguishes between multi-layered systemic and normative epistemics, a methodology that includes a set of methods for case representation (including modelling and projection), assessment, and strategy building, and a project management model that refers to more than a dozen TCSs in the field of sustainable development. Problems of validity of TCSs as a research methodology are discussed. Findings: Three major strengths of the TCS approach presented in the paper are: that it is based on three sound paradigms, which focus on different, relevant characteristics of complex, human-environment systems; i.e. the case study approach, transdisciplinarity and sustainable development, that it is strictly organized according to an elaborated and consistent theoretical framework that includes ontological, epistemological, methodological, and organizational considerations, and that it is itself subject to an ongoing inquiry and adaptation process. All theoretical considerations of the paper are clarified be elaborated examples from the more than 10 years experience with TCS of the authors. Practical implications : The paper gives a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation of TCS that might assist other scientists engaged in case study research and teaching to further develop their approaches. Additionally, relevant topics for further research in the field of TCS are presented which hopefully induce an inspiring discussion among case study researchers. Originality/value: As far we know, this paper is one of the first that presents a comprehensive and theoretically sound overview of applying transdisciplinary case studies as means of sustainability learning. Thus, it can be seen as a first, crucial step for establishing the new research field of TCS research and a sound research community of complex, transdisciplinary problem solving towards sustainability learning. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Learning; Strategic planning; Sustainable development",,,,,,,"Adger, W.N., Brown, K., Fairbrass, J., Jordan, A., Paavola, J., Rosendo, S., Governance for sustainability: Towards a 'thick' analysis of environmental decision making (2003) Environment & Planning A, 35 (6), pp. 1095-1110; Ashford, N.A., Major challenges to engineering education for sustainable development: What has to change to make it creative, effective, and acceptable to the established disciplines?

Design/methodology/ approach: Econometric methods of transition data analysis/duration modeling were applied to a dataset on unemployed individuals in order to learn whether deregistration from the employment office decreases unemployment duration. Findings: The paper finds that only 29 percent of the unemployed obtained a job simultaneously with deregistering from the Public Employment Office. Others continued to search for job on their own. The predicted risk of getting a job is non-monotonic and tends to decrease at longer duration intervals. There is a significant excess in job finding rates following employment office deregistration. Research limitations/implications: The paper is based on information from unemployment registry of a single industrial city, which might limit its usefulness elsewhere. Practical implications: The paper identifies groups of individuals who are likely to exit employment office without finding a job. Originality/value: This paper uses results of the first follow-up survey of unemployed who deregister from employment offices and provides new evidence on the duration of unemployment spell in Russia. Results are particularly useful for individuals who are interested in the design of unemployment insurance system in Russia and its impact on the duration of unemployment spell. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economics; Russia; Transition management; Unemployment",,,,,,,"Andrienko, Y., Understanding the crime growth in Russia during the transition period: A criminometric approach (2001) HSE Economic Journal, 5 (2), pp. 194-220; Atkinson, A., Micklewright, J., Unemployment compensation and labour market transitions: A critical review (1991) Journal of Economic Literature, 29 (4), pp. 1679-1727; Bean, C.R., European unemployment: A survey (1994) Journal of Economic Literature, 32 (2), pp. 573-619; Blossfeld, H.-P., Hamerle, A., Mayer, K., (1989) Event History Analysis, , Erlbaum Hillsdale, NJ; Bring, J., Carling, K., Attrition and misclassification of drop-outs in the analysis of unemployment duration (2000) Journal of Official Statistics, 16 (4), pp. 321-330; Carling, K., Edin, P.-A., Harkman, A., Holmlund, B., Unemployment duration, unemployment benefits, and labor market programs in Sweden (1996) Journal of Public Economics, 59 (3), pp. 313-334; Cockx, B., Ries, J., (2004) The Exhaustion of Unemployment Benefits in Belgium: Does it Enhance the Probability of Employment?, , Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), IZA Discussion Papers 1177; Denisova, I., (2002) Staying Longer in Unemployment Registry in Russia: Lack of Education, Bad Luck, or Something Else?, , working paper New Economics School; Fedorov, L., Sahn, D., (2004) Socio-Economic Determinants of Children's Health in Russia: Estimating a Dynamic Health Production Function, , Working paper No. 135 Cornell Food & Nutrition Policy Program; Foley, M., (1997) The Determinants of Unemployment Duration in Russia, , Working paper No. 81 University of Michigan; Grogan, L., Van Den Berg, G.J., The duration of unemployment in Russia (2001) Journal of Population Economics, 14 (3), pp. 549-568; Gutierrez, R.G., Parametric frailty and shared frailty survival models (2002) Stata Journal, 2 (1), pp. 22-44; (1995) World Labour Report, , International Labour Organization Geneva; Ham, J.C., Rea, S.A., Unemployment insurance and male unemployment duration in Canada (1987) Journal of Labor Economics, 5 (3), pp. 325-353; Hussmanns, R., International standards on the measurement of economic activity, employment, unemployment and underemployment (1994) Labour Statistics for A Market Economy: Challenges and Solutions in the Transition Countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, , Central European University Press in association with the International Labour Office Budapest; Hussmanns, R., (2001) Unemployment Statistics: Important Issues, , working paper, Training Workshop on Labour Market Information and Analysis Harare; Kapelushnikov, R., (2002) Obschaja i Registrirujamaja Bezrabotitsa: V chem Prichiny Razriva?, , Working paper WP3/2002/03State University, Higher School of Economics; Klugman, J., Kolev, A., The role of the safety net and the labor market on falling cash consumption in Russia: 1994-96.

Design/methodology/approach - A sample from the He Bei Light Industry Directory was selected by the systematic-selection-from-lists procedure. The survey instrument was adapted from the widely used MARKOR scale. Findings - Although some of the early results are consistent with those obtained in the West, an underlying lacuna needs to be addressed in order for a useful culture-sensitive interpretation of market orientation to be offered vis-à-vis locale-specific knowledge. Research implications/limitations - While there can be little doubt that market orientation delivers superior performance in developed western economies, implementations in many transition-economy contexts reveal a range of paradoxes, which point to some gaps in both the theory and practice of marketing. Originality/value - A useful explanation of market orientation in transition economies should necessarily embed an approach that accommodates the institutional peculiarities of the environment under study, focusing the temporal, spatial and wider socio-cultural and historical characteristics of marketing itself. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Market orientation; Transition management",,,,,,,"Akimova, I., ""Development if market orientation and competitiveness of Ukrainian firms"" (2000) European Journal of Marketing, 34 (9-10), pp. 1128-1148; Arndt, J., ""The political economy of marketing systems: Reviving the institutional approach"" (1981) Journal of Macromarketing, 1 (1), pp. 36-47; Bogel, G., Huszty, A., ""Transition to a market economy as inflection points: Can strategy help?""

Design/methodology/approach - The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for compressible flows are solved. Turbulence is modeled using an explicit algebraic stress model and k-ω turbulence closure. A numerical method has been developed, based on a cell-centered finite volume approach with Roe's approximate Riemann solver and formally second-order- accurate MUSCL extrapolation. The method is validated versus two severe test cases, namely, the subsonic flow through a turbine cascade with separated-flow transition; and the transonic flow through a compressor cascade with transitional boundary layers, shock-induced separation and corner stall. For the first test case, the transition model of Mayle for separated flow has been employed, whereas, for the second one, the transition has been modeled employing the Abu-Ghannam and Shaw correlation. Findings - The comparison of numerical results with the experimental data available in the literature shows that, for such complex flow configurations, an improved numerical solution could be achieved by employing transition models. Unfortunately, the available models are case-dependent, each of them being suitable for specific applications. Originality/value - A state-of-the-art numerical methodology has been developed and applied to compute very complex flows in turbomachinery. Through an original analysis of the results, the merits and limits of the considered approach have been assessed. The paper points up the fundamental role of transition modeling for turbomachinery flow simulations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Compressible flow; Finite volume methods; Separation; Transition management; Turbines; Turbulence","Compressible flow; Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Finite volume method; Navier Stokes equations; Separation; Turbines; Turbulence; Abu-Ghannam and Shaw correlations; Shock-induced separation; Transition management; Transition modeling; Cascades (fluid mechanics); Cascades (fluid mechanics); Compressible flow; Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Finite volume method; Navier Stokes equations; Separation; Turbines; Turbulence",,,,,,"Abu-Ghannam, B.J., Shaw, R., Natural transition of boundary layers - The effect of turbulence, pressure gradient and flow history (1980) Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science, 22 (5), pp. 213-228; Brandt, A., Guide to multigrid development (1982) Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 960, pp. 220-312. , Springer Verlag Berlin; Cho, R., Chung, M.K., A k-ε-γ equation turbulence model (1992) J.

By estimating survivor functions and semi-parametric hazard regression models with time-varying covariates for the timing of first union and first birth, we find a long delay among the youngest cohorts, but also remarkably strong period effects. Reduced employment, increased educational enrolment, and a higher level of uncertainty are important drivers behind these changes. Moreover, our evidence suggests that certain policy changes during the transition have exacerbated this effect, having an asymmetric impact on family formation - depending on the social status of individuals. © Springer 2006.","Event history analysis; Family formation; Family policy; Hungary; Transition","childbearing; cohabitation; cohort analysis; demographic transition; family structure; population policy; social status; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Hungary",,,,,,"(2003) Structural Change and Modernization in Post-socialist Societies, , Krämer-Verlag, Hamburg; Billari, F.C., Kohler, H.-P., Patterns of low and lowest-low fertility in Europe (2004) Population Studies, 58 (2), pp. 161-176; Billari, F.C., Philipov, D., Women's education and entry into a first union.

Today's environmental product policies focus, rather, on a few arbitrary product groups. Selectiveness should serve absolute environmental impact reduction, which asks for a rational product-selection and target framework. The authors propose ""life-cycle impact per consumer expenditure"" as a key criterion. This criterion helps to connect macro environmental impact reduction aims with product innovation targets, even under continuous economic growth, consumption pattern shifts, and rebound threats. The authors analyze the Dutch economy as an exercise. This results in 44 product groups, labeled ""Hyenas"" by the authors, that need to improve their ratio score drastically between now and 2040. Some magnitudes of desired change are given. Finally, intervention processes at the Hyena group level along the lines of sustainable transition management are proposed. Joint visioning, experimental portfolios, interaction between micro, meso, and macro change levels, and gradual pressure building are crucial elements in this concept of complex change management. © 2006 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University.","Decoupling; Eco-design; Hybrid life-cycle assessment; Innovation; Rebound effect; Sustainable transition","Costs; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Strategic planning; Ecodesign; Hybrid life cycle assessment; Product policy strategy; Rebound effects; Sustainable transition; Environmental engineering; economic growth; environmental impact; environmental policy; policy strategy; product development; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; Western Europe",,,,,,"(2004) Vier Vergezichten Op Nederland.

Design/methodology/approach - The applicability of the Chinese process as an alternative for transition economies involves an analysis of the necessary reforms regarding price liberalisation-stabilisation; privatisation; institutions; monetary policy and the financial system; fiscal policy; international trade and foreign aid and social policy. Findings - The transition process in China has maintained political-ideological authoritarianism and state control of the whole economy. Therefore, it was not the ""special initial conditions"" of China that made the model inappropriate but, rather, the switch to a democratic political-ideological-economic structure in transition economies. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the transition literature by demonstrating that the strategy was only rendered workable in China, as the governments of transition economies neither had the mandate nor wanted to reimpose tight state direction of the politics, ideology and economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Political systems; Transition management",,,,,,,"Aslund, A., Comment on 'Gradual versus Rapid Liberalisation in Socialist Economies' by McKinnon (1993) Proceedings of the World Bank Annual Conference on Development Economies, World Bank, Washington, DC, pp. 95-9; Barratt-Brown, M., (1995) Models in Political Economy, , Penguin Books Melbourne; Blackburn, R., Russia should be looking east, not west (1991) New Left Review, 198, pp. 137-40; Bowles, P., Xiao-Yuan, D., Current success and future challenges in China's economic reforms (1994) New Left Review, 208, pp. 49-76; Cao, Y.Z., Fan, G., Woo, W.T., Chinese economic reforms: Past successes and future challenges (1997) Economies in Transition, Comparing Asia and Europe, pp. 19-40. , Woo, W.T.

Design/methodology/approach - The research used the Harrod-Domar model together with an interpretation proposed by Barro and Sala-i-Martin to determine the growth threshold level of jobless growth in Poland. The technical, econometric calculation does not dominate the paper, which is destined for both academic and non-academic readers studying the phenomenon of jobless growth. Findings - The paper provides a review of literature and theories of jobless growth. The calculations show that Poland has a high threshold of jobless growth. The Polish GDP needs to grow at least 4 per cent to add new jobs. Research limitations/implications - To evaluate the overall long run impact of labor productivity on the job market one needs to include the growth of non-manufacturing jobs in the service sectors which accommodate the needs of more affluent worker/consumers. This long-term analysis is outside the scope of the paper. Practical implications - The authors calculated an important variable for the Polish economy, i.e. the threshold growth rate of jobless growth, which indicates a minimum rate of growth, needed to create a net demand for labor. This research is likely to be quoted by the economists studying sources of unemployment in Poland and as well as in any high growth economies. Originality/value - It is the only research known to the authors attempting to explain high level of unemployment in transition economies using recognized economic theories.

This article briefly summarizes the essay's key arguments, retraces some relevant history pertaining to the past decade of environmental policy making, and highlights some of the areas in which this work touches on topical issues within the environmental social sciences.

Findings - Based on the author's experience managing many assignments for large corporations, when six conditions for igniting a transformation process are fulfilled, and are coupled with these six requisites of leadership engagement, real change will occur. Research limitations implications - As one case indicates, teams that employ the author's approach can become a model for others in their organization. Practical implications - Effective leaders helping to produce real value for great teams have to go for change selectively, constructively, personally and, above all, credibly.

Differentiated transition contexts determine the form and direction of regime change in response to these pressures. The articulation of pressures, and the degree to which responses are coordinated and based on resources available within the regime, define the transition context. Four alternative contexts are described: endogenous renewal; re-orientation of trajectories; emergent transformation and purposive transitions.

However, our understanding of how sustainability indicators systems are linked to policy systems and processes is still limited. Using a 'policy orientation' as an analytical strategy, we investigate the processes surrounding the creation, diffusion, dissemination, and utilisation of sustainability indicators at the national scale of policy-making. Utilising an empirical case study of Malaysia, this paper seeks to answer two questions: How are indicators currently used in policy systems; and, have sustainability indicators had policy impacts in the past? The latter is addressed using policy learning as a frame of analysis. © Imperial College Press.","Indicator utilisation; Malaysia; Policy learning; Sustainability indicators","environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; learning; sustainability; Asia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Southeast Asia",,,,,,"Aiken, S.R., Leigh, C.H., Leinbach, T.R., Moss, M.R., (1982) Development and Environment in Peninsular Malaysia, , Singapore: McGraw Hill International; Bell, S., Morse, S., (2003) Measuring Sustainability: Learning from Doing, , London: Earthscan; Bell, S., Morse, S., Experiences with sustainability indicators and stakeholder participation: A case study relating to a 'Blue Plan' project in Malta (2004) Sustainable Development, 12 (1), pp. 1-14; Bennett, C.J., Howlett, M., The lessons of learning: Reconciling theories of policy learning and policy change (1992) Policy Sciences, 25 (3), pp. 275-294; Biderman, A.D., Social indicators and goals (1966) Social Indicators, pp. 68-153. , RA Bauer (ed.), Massachussets: The M.I.T.

Box 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Over the past decades, the Dutch people have been confronted with severe water-related problems, which are the result of an unsustainable water system, arising from human interventions in the physical infrastructure of the water system and the water management style. The claims of housing, industry, infrastructure and agriculture have resulted in increasing pressure on the water system. The continuous subsidence of soil and climate change has put pressure on the land. Hence, the nature and magnitude of water-related problems have changed. Longitudinal research of relevant national policy documents reveals that the water management regime has changed its water management style over the past 30 years from a technocratic scientific style towards an integral and participatory style. We have investigated if the historical development in Dutch Water management can be characterized as a transition. Based on longitudinal research through an integrated systems analysis, document research and expert interviews, we have reconstructed the historical narrative by using the transition concepts of multi-level and multi-phase. This research indicates that the shift in Dutch Water management can be characterized as a transition. This transition is currently in the take-off stage and near the acceleration stage. This is a crucial stage as long as the considerable gap between the strategic macro-vision and the practical implementation at the micro-level remains. As long as these levels are not compatible (modulation), the transition will not be completed successfully. Transition management as multi-level governance model should therefore be adopted to facilitate the modulation.","Sustainability; Transition management; Transitions; Water management",,,,,,,"Berkhout, F., Smith, A., Stirling, A., Socio-technical regimes and transitions contexts (2003) SPRU Electronic Working Paper Series; Bosch, A., Van Der Ham, W., (1998) Twee Eeuwen Rijkswaterstaat, 1798-1990 (Two Centuries Rijkswaterstaat, 1798-1990) Europese Bibliotheek, Zaltbommel; De Bruijn, D., Hamhuis, D., Van Nieuwenhuijze, L., Overmars, W., Sijmons, D., Vera, F., (1987) Ooievaar: de Toekomst Van Het Rivierengebied.

This requires 'radical' or 'system' innovations. In this respect, there is an important difference between consumer economies such as Europe, the EU and Japan, emerging economies such as China and Malaysia in Asia and bottom-of-the-pyramid economies where people survive on 1-2 dollars a day: • In consumer economies, the physical economic infrastructure is already fully developed, which often causes important 'lock-in' problems with regard to realising radical change. • In emerging economies (which might bring about the biggest leap in environmental pressure) this infrastructure, by and large, still has to be built up, so that, in theory, there is much more freedom to design sustainable systems from the onset. • In bottom of the pyramid economies, markets are so different that copying Western market systems is factually quite difficult, although examples and innovative solutions are required anyway. But is this 'leapfrogging', particularly by emerging economies, while theoretically possible and practically desirable, really going to happen? Current experiences are not encouraging: 'dinosaur' industries such as the car industry are invited to invest heavily in countries such as China leading to a transplantation of existing problematic transport infrastructures. This paper argues that, where Western countries need a system innovation and transition management approach to realise a change to sustainability, emerging economies would have to apply something very similar to ensure that the larger flexibility they have is indeed used to leapfrog to sustainable systems. This implies that functions such as visioning, indicative planning, foresight and reflexive governance have to be fostered to ensure that foreign and national investments are used to create sustainable systems.

Design/methodology/approach - Presents primary empirical research into career management in the Estonian civil service since 1991, that is, in the post-Soviet era. The research involved in-depth interviews with a group of 12 senior staff employed by the Estonian civil service. Findings - The interview data reveal the ways in which downsizing and de-layering in the Estonian public sector have led to shortened career paths, increased functional flexibility, increased spans of control and shifts towards open job systems. Research limitations/implications - The research explored career-related issues solely within the Estonian civil service. Further research would be needed in a wider range of organisations and countries before the transferability of the findings could be established to transitional economies more generally. Practical implications - Provides practical insights into the difficulties of career management in transitional economies situations from an HR perspective. Originality/value - Offers a valuable contribution by demonstrating that, within certain parameters, Western-based career management strategies and techniques may be adapted to fit transitional public services in Estonia but only as one element of a comprehensive HR modernisation programme. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Careers; Estonia; Public sector organizations; Transition management",,,,,,,"Arthur, M.B., Hall, D.T., Lawrence, B.S., Generating new directions in career theory: The case for a transdisciplinary approach (1989) Handbook of Career Theory, pp. 7-25. , Arthur, M.B.

Based on interview research with 30 female professionals in St Petersburg, Russia, we unravel the complexities of the ""woman question"" in soviet discourse and explore the individual subjectivities of managing gender and managing transition. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a life-history qualitative research approach. We examine how transition from a Marxist system to a free market economy has impacted employment experiences of women. Findings - It is shown that women have traditionally progressed in managerial and professional fields in Soviet society but that this advancement is being reversed during transition stages. Emphasising the socio-political legacies of the Soviet gender order, we highlight how dominant gender roles are being reinforced along essentialist lines. The results highlight how women's work identity is being reconstructed along stereotypically feminine lines. This feminisation of work identity however, focuses on the aesthetic qualities of being a professional woman rather than on personal managerial qualities. We argue that the construction and reconstruction of a feminine professional self is an important aspect of managing gender and transition. The results also highlight an increase in discriminatory practices in HR systems and that women face both cultural and organisational barriers to their career advancement. Originality/value - The paper argues that socialist ideology did not solve the woman question, but rather produced different forms of gendered inequalities. It suggests that equal opportunities will only be achieved when organisations comply with employment legislation. The research provides important insights into the gendered management processes within transitional contexts, which have previously remained uncharted. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Feminism; Russia; Sexual discrimination; Transition management; Women",,,,,,,"Acker, J., ""Jobs, hierarchies, bodies: A theory of gendered organisation"" (1990) Gender and Society, 4, pp. 139-158. , June; Acker, J., Barry, K., Esseveld, J., ""Objectivity and truth: Problems in doing feminist research"" (1983) Women's Studies International Forum, 6 (4), pp. 235-423; Adkins, L., (2002) Revisions: Gender and Sexuality in Late Modernity, , Open University Press, Buckingham; Ardichvili, A., ""Leadership styles and work-related values of managers and employees of manufacturing enterprises in post-communistic countries"" (2001) Human Resource Development Quarterly, 12 (4), pp. 363-383; Ardichvili, A., Gasparishivili, A., ""Human resource development in an industry in transition"" (2001) Human Resource Development International, 4 (1), pp. 47-63; Ashwin, S., ""The influence of the Soviet gender order on employment behaviour in contemporary Russia"" (2002) Sociological Research, 41 (1), pp. 27-37; Ashwin, S., Lyktina, T., ""Men in crisis in Russia: The role of domestic marginalisation"" (2004) Gender and Society, 18, pp. 189-206. , April; Belsey, C., Moore, J., (1997) The Feminist Reader, , (Eds.)

The worker-mother contract in socialist systems is discussed and reveals how transition from a communist economic system to a market economy has eroded women's equality within the workplace claimed with the Communist and economic social legacy. The aim is to explore the opportunities and constraints on women's professional career advancement in post-socialist societies. Design/methodology/approach - The paper consolidates research on gender and work within CEE countries and draws on international datasets including, the Gender Development Index and Gender Empowerment Index. Findings - The results show that women's high representation in management and professional occupations, once the hallmark of socialist employment structures, is now being threatened by the erosion of state childcare services and the increasing level of discriminatory practices in recruitment, selection and development. It is suggested that the formal state structures have acted to foster neo-traditionalism and a traditional gender identity. Economic and political transition is argued to be a process of remasculinisation, which reaffirms gendered hierarchies and gendered power relations in public and private realms. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the limited subject of equal opportunities and gender issues within an organisation context within CEE regions.

Using survey data the paper reviews women's responses to organisation change in a transition context. The paper focuses specifically on economic and social changes that are occurring in Estonia following its reassertion of independence from the Soviet Union. Design/methodology/approach - A contextual background to transition is provided and the recent history of Estonia is charted in relation to the demise of the Soviet Union and events in the recent post-Soviet era. The paper discusses the issue of whether women have, in general terms, benefited from Estonia's move away from the Soviet Union and into the independent European State of Estonia. Estonia's membership of the European Union is highlighted as a key factor that is likely to influence the experiences of women managers in the future. The results of a comparative survey (n = 682) into the attitudes of Estonian women managers towards various change management issues at the organisation level are presented. Findings - The results of the study suggest that many women face cultural barriers to advancement in the workplace, and that women are seeking out opportunities in response to economic and social change. Recent legislation changes suggest however, that Estonia's institutional framework will assist women's career development and position in the economic sphere. Research implications - There is a need for more focused gender-based management research relating to Estonia. Such research could, in part, be based on information gathered from the further development of formal gender-specific employment monitoring practices at both organisational and governmental levels in Estonia. Originality/value - Because there is a dearth of gender-focused research across Central and Eastern Europe, this paper provides valuable insights into the effects of independence on the experiences of women in Estonia. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic change; Estonia; Social change; Transition management; Women",,,,,,,"Atlas, R., Vadi, M., ""The impact of organisational culture on attitudes concerning change in post-soviet organisations"" (2004) Journal for East European Management Studies, 9 (1), pp. 20-39; Alyanak, L., ""Baltic blues"" (1999) World of Work: The Magazine of the ILO, 31, pp. 1-2. , September/October; Brainerd, E., ""Women in transition: Changes in gender wage differentials in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union"" (2000) Industrial and Labor Review, 54 (1), pp. 138-162; Bryans, P., Mavin, S., ""Women learning to become managers: Learning to fit in or to play a different game?""

Design/methodology/approach - Reviews the literature on and practice of e-government, as well as the related literature of strategic alignment and maturity models for technology adoption. Offers evidence for the model's validity through case-type material from the web sites of e-governments worldwide. Findings - Six transition paths can be identified, four of which are more likely to result in effective e-government transition. Research limitations/implications - Further work is needed to test the validity of the model. This could involve historical and longitudinal studies of the government to e-government transition process in different governments around the world. Practical implications - The transition model should be of value to e-government strategic planners who are seeking possible transition paths towards the effective development of e-government. Originality/value - The paper tackles the little investigated topic of the transition process through which governments must go as they shift from traditional government to e-government. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication technologies; Government; Strategic alignment; Transition management",,,,,,,"(2000) EGovernment: Connecting the Dots, , available at: www.accenture.com/xdoc/en/industries/government/ egovernmenta4.pdf; Implementing eGovernment: Rhetoric and reality (2000) Insights, (2). , available at: www.accenture.com/xdoc/en/industries/government/ egovernmenta4.pdf; (2001) EGovernment Leadership: Rhetoric vs. Reality - Closing the Gap, , available at: www.accenture.com/xdoc/en/industries/government/ 2001FullReport.pdf; (2002) EGovernment Leadership: Realizing the Vision, , available at: www.accenture.com/xdoc/en/industries/government/ eGovApril20023.pdf; (2003) EGovernment Leadership: Engaging the Customer, , available at: www.accenture.com/xdoc/en/newsroom/epresskit/egovernment/ egovepress.pdf; Bevir, M., Rhodes, R.A.W., Weller, P., Traditions of governance: Interpreting the changing role of the public sector (2003) Public Administration, 81 (1), pp. 1-17; Burn, J., Robins, G., Moving towards eGovernment: A case study of organisational change processes (2003) Logistics Information Management, 16 (1), pp. 25-35; Chen, H., Digital government: Technologies and practices (2002) Decision Support Systems, 34 (3), pp. 223-7; Ciborra, C.U., (2003) Unveiling E-government and Development: Governing at a Distance in the New War, , Working Paper 126, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, available at: http://is.lse.ac.uk/wp/pdf/WP126.PDF; Criado, J.I., Ramilo, M.C., E-government in practice: An analysis of web site orientation to the citizens in Spanish municipalities (2003) The International Journal of Public Sector Management, 16 (3), pp. 191-218; Galliers, R.D., Sutherland, A.R., Information systems management and strategy formulation: The 'stages of growth model' revisited (1991) Journal of Information Systems, 1 (2), pp. 89-114; Gendron, Y., Cooper, D.J., Townley, B., (1999) In the Name of Accountability, Accountability Gets Lost: State Auditing in the Province of Alberta and New Public Management, , paper presented at the Critical Perspectives on Accounting Conference, 22-24 April, City University of New York, New York, NY; Henderson, J.C., Venkatraman, N., Strategic alignment: Leveraging information technology for transforming organisations (1993) IBM Systems Journal, 32 (1), pp. 4-16; (1998) Digital 21: HKSAR Information Technology Strategy, , November Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Hong Kong; (2004) Digital 21 Strategy: Sustainability and Opportunities, , March Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Hong Kong; Ho, A.L., EO allots 1-2% of RP budget to e-government spending (2003) Inquirer News Service, 23; Hodgkinson, S., (2002) Managing an E-government Transformation Program, , paper presented at the Working Towards Whole-of-Government Online Conference, Canberra, September; Hood, C., A public management for all seasons?

We argue that sustainability is best viewed as a socially instituted process of adaptive change in which innovation is a necessary element. We discuss four key elements of governance for sustainability, which are integrated into the concept of transition management. The result is a conceptual framework for policy-making and action-taking aimed at progress towards sustainability.

Recent studies have provided insight into how technological transitions may come about and may be managed. However, there is a lack of methodologies aimed at starting off transitions or system innovations, in practice. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a methodology characterized by a bottom-up approach to generate a roadmap for short-term projects within a long-term perspective.

The California Psychological Inventory, the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, and well-being measures were administered to 290 Romanian engineers. The Big Five personality dimensions were derived by means of factor analysis with the personality questionnaires. The results confirmed that job satisfaction was negatively related to neuroticism and was positively related to conscientiousness, and that depression and somatic complaints were negatively related to extraversion and were positively related to neuroticism. Unexpectedly, job satisfaction was positively related to openness to experience, and depression and somatic complaints were negatively related to openness to experience and were positively related to agreeableness. We concluded that most of the relationships between personality and well-being outcomes found in Western countries were confirmed in an East-European country and that differences in the relationships can be explained by cultural-societal factors. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

They call for a more proactive approach. One of them advocates systems change driven by technological innovations accompanied by institutional and sociocultural transformations. Transition management is a new policy strategy based on this philosophy. It has recently emerged in the Netherlands and has been adopted by the Dutch government as a relevant framework for shaping its policy towards sustainability. The transition management writings emphasise the importance of 'learning' in the process of induced change towards sustainability. Although this can indeed be quite a significant means for inducing change, the literature on transition management is not explicit enough about the methodological organisation of the learning process. Since transition management has become an important approach in the Netherlands, we consider it relevant to deploy some learning insights and experience gained in the Dutch Climate OptiOns for the Long-term (COOL) project to analyse and improve the process of transition management. In particular, we look into the first two steps of transition management, i.e., organising a transition arena and making visions. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - Accordingly, the paper uses an abstracted and generic framework of antecedents to ""deinstitutionalisation"" (the erosion or discontinuity of institutionalized organisational activities or practices) to analyse a case study of how a UK local government council is responding to an environmental agenda in the context of an array of gradual political, functional and social pressures to change its activities. Findings - The findings of the study indicate how, in different ways, environmental accounting is pressed into use to promote such change. Originality/value - Contrary to other frameworks which emphasise how environmental accounting is potentially constructive/empowering or captured/colonized, drawing on this case study the paper argues that environmental accounting may in contrast be mobilised to contribute to a process of deinstitutionalisation, even when attempts to develop such accounting are not entirely successful. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accounting; Change management; Local government",,,,,,,"Commission, A., (1997) It's a Small World: Local Government's Role As a Steward of the Environment, , Audit Commission London; Commission, A., (1999) It's a Small World: A Review of Progress in Environmental Stewardship, , Audit Commission London; Ball, A., (2002) Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government: An Agenda for Research, , ACCA Research Report, No. 78 Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, London; Ball, A., (2003) Environmental Accounting and Change: Exploring the Institutional Toolkit, , paper presented at the 26th Annual Congress of the European Accounting Association Sevilla, 2-4 April; Ball, A., Broadbent, J., Jarvis, T., (2003) Waste Management, the Challenges of the Private Finance Initiative, and Sustainability Reporting, , working paper, Royal Holloway, University of London Egham; Bebbington, J., Sustainable development: A review of the international development, business and accounting literature (2001) Accounting Forum, 25 (2), pp. 128-57; Bebbington, K.J., Gray, R.H., Thomson, I., Walters, D., Accountants' attitudes and environmentally sensitive accounting (1994) Accounting and Business Research, 94, pp. 51-75; Birkin, F., The ecological accountant: From the cogito to thinking like a mountain (1996) Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 7, pp. 231-57; Birkin, F., The art of accounting for science: A prerequisite for sustainable development?

Design/methodology/approach - A seasoned consultant describes, using frank, first-hand account, examples of institutional change. Findings - Shows how institutional change is often forced on organizations by shifting external forces that render old niches obsolete. Also shows the difficulty in mobilizing to confront the need for serious change, and how leadership transitions are often a central part of the change process. Originality/value - The author points to three main lessons from this case study. Institutional change may be arduous, but it can also leave people feeling amazed at how long they tolerated the old system. The author also notes that institutional change is a natural process, proceeding with a life all its own. The author concludes with some thoughts on how to initiate this process when an organization appears ready. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change management; Management succession; Organizational change; Transformational leadership; Transition management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10748121,,,10.1108/10748120510601671,,"English","On the Horizon",Review,Scopus

Furthermore, the impacts of this possible transition on professional and educational branches (PEBs) are examined. It is based on the study completed in Lahti Center at the Helsinki University of Technology between years 2001-2003. In the study, the most important developing key technologies were defined and their impacts on professions analysed through the application of Delphi technique. The developing key technology groups were information and communication technology, biotechnology, and material and nanotechnology. In addition, combinations of these technologies, that is, so-called fusion technologies, were also subjects for analysis. The first empirical aim was to analyse the plausibility and the timing of the so-called technological theses. The following technologies (technological theses) were deemed to be the most important ones: highly selective drugs, sensors, integrated technology, biomedical materials, photonic materials, 3G technology, intelligent materials, diagnostics, and virtual reality. The second empirical objective of the study was to analyze the professional and educational impacts of these technologies.

In this paper, we emphasize the role of country level demographics in explaining these differences. In particular, looking over the period 1960-2002, we show that cross-country data support the notion that, starting in the late 1970s, countries went through a period of technological transition that lasted at least until the mid-1990s for the fastest adjusting countries and is still proceeding for the slower adjusting countries. The main claim of the paper is that the country-level rate of labour growth was a key factor driving the speed of adjustment to the new technological paradigm, implying that much of the cross-country difference in economic performance over recent decades can be explained by demographic differences across countries as opposed to the many other factors emphasized in the literature. © Canadian Economics Association.",,"demography; economic development; productivity",,,,,,"Aghion, P., Howitt, P.W., 'On the macroeconomic effects of major technological change' (1998) General Purpose Technologies and Economic Growth, , ed.

Method: A standard questionnaire was designed to record prospective data on 740 patients with a follow up during 28 days. Multivariate analysis was performed using the logistic regression model with all-factors as well as age, gender, CHD risk factors as predictors of the delay and fatality. 54% of patients were admitted during the first 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. In multivariate analysis, the delay of consultation is significantly correlated with gender (OR=2.3, p < 0.001), age (OR=1.02, p < 0.01) and health insurance (OR=1.5, p < 0.01). 90% of patients consulted in emergency wards. The emergency ambulance transported 19.6% of patients. 48% of patients underwent early revascularisation of thrombolysis, 51% on men vs 31% on women (p < 0.01). The fatality rate was higher on women 14% vs 6.4% on men p < 0.01) at 5 days and 27.2% vs 13.6% at 28 days. In multivariate analysis, the principal fatality predictive factor was age (RR=1.08, p < 0.001) and delay (2.56 p <0.001) and tobacco smoking (RR=2,83, p <0.0001). Conclusion: this study highlighted the problem of acute myocardial infarction management in public hospitals in Tunisia and it constitutes a baseline to assess different interventions focusing on cardiovascular diseases control and surveillance.","Delay; Fatality; Gender Differences- Epidemiological Transition; Management; Myocardial Infarction","acute heart infarction; adult; aged; article; blood clot lysis; cardiovascular risk; emergency ward; fatality; female; health care delivery; hospitalization; human; male; patient care; prediction; questionnaire; revascularization; smoking; Tunisia; Age Factors; Aged; Female; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Insurance, Health; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Sex Factors; Time Factors; Tunisia",,,,,,"(1998) Le Rapport sur la Santé dans le Monde, , Genève; (1999) Rapport sur la Santé dans le Monde 1999 «pour un Réel Changement», , Genève; Murray, C.J.I., Lopez, A.D., (1996) The Global Burden of Disease: A Comprehensive Assessment of Mortality and Disability from Diseases, Injuryes, and Risk Factors in 1990 and Projected to 2020, 1. , Combridge.

It has created an awareness of new needs and stimulated the development in both pre- and in-service teacher training. The ability to adapt to societal transitions is a skill to be developed in teachers. Rather than working for the socialization of students into the status quo, schools can educate students to be proactive agents of social change.

The analysis demonstrates that the step from experimental R&D to commercial production is particularly difficult for the incumbents. This observation is explained by showing that whereas manufacturing of large power plants rests upon extensive systems integration capabilities, distributed generators are based on a 'plug-and-play' logic. © ICC Association 2005; all rights reserved.",,"manufacturing; power plant; research and development",,,,,,"Acha, V., Davies, A., Hobday, M., Salter, A., 'Exploring the capital goods economy: Complex product systems in the UK' (2004) Industrial and Corporate Change, 13 (3), pp. 505-529; Anderson, C., 'Anläggningsprojekt och organisatoriskt lärande' (1998), Licentiate Thesis, Linköping University, LinköpingArora, A., Fosfuri, A., Gambardella, A., (2001) Markets for Technologies, , MIT Press: Cambridge, MA; (2001) Submission to the Cabinet Office Energy Review, , BG Group 7th September; Breschi, S., Lissoni, F., Malerba, F., 'Knowledge proximity and technological diversification' (1998), mimeo, CESPRI/Università BocconiBrusoni, S., Prencipe, A., 'Unpacking the black box of modularity: Technologies, products and organisations' (2001) Industrial and Corporate Change, 10 (1), pp. 179-205; Brusoni, S., Prencipe, A., Pavitt, K., 'Knowledge specialization, organizational coupling and the boundaries of the firm: Why do firms know more than they make?'

Data were obtained from multiple sources. The results indicate that sociability- cooperation was associated with peer acceptance and teacher-rated competence, whereas aggression was associated with social and school difficulties in all 3 cohorts. The effect of different social contexts was reflected mainly in the relations between shyness-sensitivity and adjustment. Whereas shyness was associated with social and academic achievement in the 1990 cohort, the associations became weaker or nonsignificant in the 1998 cohort. Furthermore, shyness was associated with peer rejection, school problems, and depression in the 2002 cohort. © 2005 by the Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - A political economy methodology to the transition process results in alternative transition models. As a result five alternative models of transition come into being. Findings - Transition models can be distinguished on the basis of economic analysis, speed and the political structure. Each model recommended a set of economic policies to facilitate the transition process. The adoption of gradualist processes of transition - except in the case of shock therapy - requires a sequence by which the reforms should be introduced. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the transition literature by developing a set of economic policies combined with a sequence path for each transition model. © Emerald Group publishing Limited.","Economic policy; Politics; Transition management",,,,,,,"Argyrous, G., Stilwell, F., Why do economists disagree?

Design/methodology/approach - Case studies are the main tool of theory development. The paper focuses mainly on German and Swiss product manufacturers, whose products require a high level of customer investment. Findings - The objective was merely to explain behavioral dimension of transition. The paper indicated seven behavioral processes which play a critical role during the transition. Managerial service awareness and role understanding, as well as employee service awareness and role understanding seem to be the right triggers to change the behavioral processes in the desired manner. Research limitations/implications - The main focus was on the German and Swiss machinery and medical equipment manufacturing industries, and the remarks are limited to these sectors. Practical implications - The key managerial implications and recommendations can be formulated as follows: establish a ""value-added"" managerial service awareness; change managerial role understanding - from traditional customer support to business manager; establish a ""value-added"" employee service awareness; and change employee role understanding - from selling products to providing services. Originality/value - The authors were able to add a complementary perspective to existing literature on the transition process from products to services. For service management theorists, it is suggested that the transition from product manufacturers into service providers is influenced strongly by several behavioral processes. A complete theory of the transition process requires an interdisciplinary theory that integrates service management and human decision making. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Behavioral accounting; Decision making; Transition management",,,,,,,"Anderson, J.C., Narus, J.A., Capturing the value of supplementary services (1995) Harvard Business Review, 73 (3), pp. 75-83; Arkes, H., Blumer, C., The psychology of sunk cost (1985) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 35 (2), pp. 124-140; Chase, R., The customer contact approach to services: Theoretical bases and practical extensions (1981) Operations Research, 24 (4), pp. 698-706; Cyert, R., March, J., (1992) A Behavioral Theory of the Firm, , MIT Press Cambridge, MA; Deming, W.E., (1986) Out of the Crisis, , MIT Press Cambridge, MA; Einhorn, H.J., Hogarth, R.M., Behavioral decision theory: Process of judgement and choice (1986) Annual Review of Psychology, 32, pp. 53-88; Eisenhardt, K.M., Building theories from case study research (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14 (4), pp. 532-550; Evardsson, B., Service production and service marketing in manufacturing companies (1990) Proceedings of the 1st International Seminar in Service Management, , FNEGE IAE, Aix-en-Provence; Garvin, D., Leveraging processes for strategic advantage (1995) Harvard Business Review, 73, pp. 77-90; Heskett, J.L., Sasser, W.E., Schlesinger, L.A., (1997) The Service Profit Chain: How Leading Companies Link Profit and Growth to Loyalty, Satisfaction, and Value, , Free Press New York, NY; Kahnemann, D., Lovallo, D., Timid choices and bold forecasts: A cognitive perspective on risk taking (1993) Management Science, 39 (1), pp. 17-31; Kahnemann, D., Slovic, P., Tversky, A., (1982) Judgement under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge, MA; Keating, E., Oliva, R., Repenning, N., Rockart, S., Sterman, J., Overcoming the improvement paradox (1999) European Management Journal, 17 (2), pp. 120-134; Lant, T., Aspiration level adaption: An empirical exploration (1992) Management Science, 38 (5), pp. 623-644; (2002) Produktbegleitende Dienstleistungen: Konzepte und Beispiele Erfolgreicher Strategieentwicklung, , Lay, G.

Compares this environment with that of the British East India Company. Suggests that corporations operating in the unpredictable environments at the start of the 21st century, in the absence of predictable government and military assistance, of necessity, will be compelled to rethink their transition strategies. Concludes that corporations will assume greater responsibility for functions - including intelligence acquisition, law enforcement, and military projection - normally provided by traditional nation-states, following the pattern of the British East India Company. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Forward planning; Management effectiveness; Transnational companies",,,,,,,"Bobbitt, P., (2003) The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History, , Alfred A.

To prevent FPT of immunity due to suckling of the dam, newborn dairy calves should be removed from the calving area within 30 minutes of birth. First and later lactation cows are suitable colostrum donors, provided they are healthy, well-vaccinated, have had optimal transition management, and an appropriate dry-period length. Early colostrum collection yields an adequate immunoglobulin mass provided that 3 to 4 L of colostrum is fed to the newborn calf. Regular testing for the adequacy of the dairy's colostrum feeding program is an excellent way to prevent calf health problems and identify potential need for CSs or replacement products.",,"immunoglobulin; animal health; animal product; cattle; colostrum; cow; feeding behavior; immunity; lactation; nonhuman; passive transport; review; survival; vaccination; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Cattle; Colostrum; Female; Food Handling; Health Status; Immunity, Maternally-Acquired; Immunoglobulin G; Lactation; Animalia; Bos taurus",,"immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; Immunoglobulin G",,,,"Barrington, G.M., Parish, S.M., Bovine neonatal immunology (2001) Vet Clin North Am Food Anim Pract, 17, pp. 463-476; Crowther, C., Raistrick, H., A comparative study of the proteins of the colostrum and the milk of the cow and their relations to serum proteins (1916) Biochem J, 10, pp. 435-452; Brignole, T.J., Stott, G.H., Effect of suckling followed by bottle feeding colostrum on immunoglobulin absorption and calf survival (1980) J Dairy Sci, 63, pp. 451-456; Davidson, J.N., Yancey, S.P., Campbell, S.G., Relationship between serum immunoglobulin values and incidence of respiratory disease in calves (1981) J Am Vet Med Assoc, 179, pp. 708-710; Hancock, D.D., Assessing efficiency of passive immune transfer in dairy herds (1985) J Dairy Sci, 68, pp. 163-183; Besser, T.E., Gay, C.C., Pritchett, L., Comparison of three methods of feeding colostrum to dairy calves (1991) J Am Vet Med Assoc, 198, pp. 419-422; Tyler, J.W., Hancock, D.D., Wiksie, S.E., Holler, S.L., Gay, J.M., Gay, C.C., Use of serum protein concentration to predict mortality in mixed source dairy replacement heifers (1998) J Intern Med, 12, pp. 79-83; Gay, C.C., Failure of passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins and neonatal disease in calves: A review (1983) Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Neonatal Diarrhea, pp. 346-364. , Veterinary Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;; Denise, S.K., Robinson, J.D., Stott, G.H., Armstrong, D.V., Effects of passive immunity on subsequent production in dairy heifers (1989) J Dairy Sci, 72, pp. 552-554; Robison, J.D., Stott, G.H., Denise, S.K., Effects of passive immunity on growth and survival in the dairy heifer (1988) J Dairy Sci, 71, pp. 1283-1287; Wells, S.J., Dargatz, D.A., Ott, S.L., Factors associated with mortality to 22 days of life in dairy herds in the United States (1996) Prev Vet Med, 29, pp. 9-19; Weaver, D.M., Tyler, J.W., Vanmetre, D.C., Hostetler, D.E., Barrington, G.M., Passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins in calves (2000) J Vet Intern Med, 14, pp. 569-577; McBeath, D.G., Penhale, W.J., Logan, E.F., An examination of the influence of husbandry on the plasma immunoglobulin G absorption in calves (1971) Vet Rec, 88, pp. 266-270; Tyler, J.W., Hancock, D.D., Parish, S.M., Rea, D.E., Besser, T.E., Sanders, S.G., Evaluation of 3 assays for failure of passive transfer in calves (1996) J Vet Intern Med, 10, pp. 304-307; Tyler, J.W., Parish, S.M., Besser, T.E., Vanmetre, D.C., Barrington, G.M., Middleton, J.R., Detection of low serum immunoglobulin concentrations in clinically ill calves (1999) J Vet Intern Med, 13, pp. 40-43; Roy, J.H.B., (1990) The Calf.

Empirical studies show that many other obstacles prevent these technologies from penetrating the market. The relevance of these obstacles differs between sectors, firms and technologies. Consequently, a more focused approach is proposed. By taking a look at the specific, real-world barriers to clean technologies, a policy framework as well as some specific measures that target those barriers are suggested. These instruments are useful and complementary in a policy framework that, in addition to specific instruments, takes into account the influence of the style of regulation and the configuration of actors in the environmental technological change process. This paper proposes a coherent framework integrating environmental policy and technology policy instruments. This is deemed necessary in the technological transition to sustainable development.","Clean technologies; Diffusion; Public policy; Sustainable development","Economics; Environmental impact; Marketing; Productivity; Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Clean technology; Environmental economics; Sustainable development; cleaner production; environmental economics; sustainable development; technological development; technology diffusion",,,,,,"See refs 2-17Kemp, R., (1997) Environmental Policy and Technical Change: A Comparison of the Technological Impact of Policy Instruments, , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Malamanan, R., (1996) Technological Innovation for Sustainable Development: Generation and Diffusion of Industrial Cleaner Technologies, , Fondazione Eni Enrico Matei, Milan; Dupuy, D., Technological change and environmental policy: The diffusion of environmental technology (1997) Growth and Change, 28, pp. 49-66; Del Río, P., (2002) Industria, Cambio Tecnológico Y Desarrollo Sustentable.

The human body is a flesh-and-blood entity, but it also functions as a symbolic instrument. The body communicates about culture itself, about norms and boundaries. In this paper one central aspect in the phenomenology of eating disorders is emphasised: The subjective experience of lack of control and the sense of an overwhelming «chaos», both on the inner and outer level. On this basis rapid societal transitions are discussed as specific pathogenic factors. Sociocultural instability represents insecure conditions for construction of a healthy and stable identity. «The open body» is a relevant metaphor, with its dialectical relationship to the isolation and delimitation represented by eating disordered behaviour. With reference to history and geography the paper also discusses the pathoplasticity of eating disorders; how they change in time and space. Cultural analysis of eating disorders can contribute to a richer understanding of the complexity of the construction of meaning in these disorders, both across cultures and within our own cultural contexts.",,"anorexia nervosa; appetite; bulimia; comprehension; cultural anthropology; cultural factor; defense mechanism; diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders; eating disorder; geography; history; human; literature; mental patient; obsession; phenomenology; phobia; psychodynamics; religion; review; risk factor; self control; social aspect; symbolism; symptom; time; art; body image; cosmetic industry; female; male; psychological aspect; self concept; Beauty Culture; Body Image; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Culture; Eating Disorders; Female; Human Body; Humans; Male; Metaphor; Self Concept; Symbolism",,,,,,"Gordon, R.A., Eating disorders East and West: A culture-bound syndrome unbound (2001) Eating Disorders and Cultures in Transition, pp. 1-16. , Nasser M, Katzman MA, Gordon RA, red.

Transitions are necessary and have been defined as long-term, continuous processes in which a society or a subsystem changes fundamentally - interconnected changes that reinforce each other in technology, the economy, institutions, ecology, culture, behaviour and belief systems. One of the examples where transitions are necessary is in the realm of mobility. Although there is currently no accepted single strategy, promising new options are increased multimodal chain mobility (in order to reduce car mobility), and a transition towards a sustainable fuel infrastructure. In the last few years leadin g car companies have been investing in fuel-cell technologies, possibly requiring new infrastructures based on hydrogen. Innovation in the direction of hydrogen fuel cells requires a future vision that is shared by many stakeholders, collaboration between many public and private stakeholders, and experimentation in bounded socio-technical experiments, in which second-order learning processes take place about the nature of the technology, about collaboration between stakeholders with various interests, and about sustainable solutions for the future. As a case study, consumer acceptance of fuel- cell buses in Amsterdam has been analysed. In this case, special emphasis has been given to social learning among stakeholders.","Consumers; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Sustainability; Transition; Transportation","environmental management; environmental policy; sustainable development; technology policy; transportation development; Amsterdam; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; North Holland; Western Europe",,,,,,"Adamson, K.-A., 'An examination of consumer demand in the secondary niche market for fuel cell vehicles in Europe' (2003) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 28 (7), pp. 771-780; Altmann, M., Gräsel, C., 'The acceptance of hydrogen technology' (1998), www.HyWeb.de/accepth2An, F., (2003) Assessing Tank-to-Wheel Efficiencies of Advanced Technology Vehicles, , (Argonne, IL: Argonne National Laboratory): 2003-01-0412; Ashford, N., Hafkamp, W., Prakke, F., Vergragt, P.J., (2001) Pathways to Sustainable Industrial Transformations: Co-optimising Competitiveness, Employment and Environment, , (with contributions from A.

Pain management, advance care planning, and preparation for dying maybe lacking. Because prognosis is uncertain, particularly in noncancer cases, access to hospice and palliative care services is often denied to these patients until they are very near death. Home-based transition management can provide high-risk chronically ill patients belter continuity of care until they are eligible and emotionally ready for hospice, and can manage their dying if referral to hospice is refused. Home care is positioned to provide innovative services that would increase access to end of life care.

Increase of short-chained fatty acids (SCFA) will occur. Eventually, this may result in a transient nadir of ruminal pH below 5.5. Two situations are likely to represent the risk of SARA. First, fresh lactating cows are confronted with a diet considerably differing from that in the dry-period. A diet change carried out too rapidly or without proper transition management will put the animals at risk. Secondly, further in lactation, inaccurate calculation of dry-matter-intake (DMI) leading to wrong roughage/concentrate ratio, an inadequate content of structure within the diet or mistakes in preparing of total mixed rations may produce SARA. The consequences of SARA are diverse and complex. Laminitis is regularly connected to SARA and the negative impact of organic acids on the ruminal wall may lead to parakeratosis enabling translocation of pathogens into the bloodstream provoking inflammation and abscessation throughout the ruminant body. Moreover, milk-fat depression (MFD) can be related to SARA. In order to achieve a proper diagnosis, SARA has to be understood as a herd-management problem. A screening of the herd for SARA by means of a rumenocentesis, performed on a sample-group, preferably 12 individuals, may reveal the presence of SARA. The herd screening should include the risk group suspected, preferably. The prevention of SARA applies to the principles of ruminant feeding. Careful transition management from the dry to the lactation period and control of fibre-content and ration quality should be more yielding than the use of buffers or antibiotic drugs. © 2003 Blackwell Verlag.",,"Animalia; Bovidae; volatile fatty acid; acidosis; animal; animal disease; animal food; cattle; cattle disease; chemistry; female; lactation; metabolism; review; ruminant stomach; standard; stomach disease; Acidosis; Animal Feed; Animal Nutrition Physiology; Animals; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Female; Lactation; Rumen; Stomach Diseases",,"Fatty Acids, Volatile",,,,"Andersen, P.H., Bergelin, B., Christensen, K.A., Effect of feeding regimen on concentration of free endotoxin in ruminal fluid of cattle (1994) J.

We hypothesised that transition diet could alter metabolic status after calving, and thus influence fertility. Multiparous dairy cows were assigned to four transition groups 6 weeks pre-calving and fed: (a) basal control diet (n = 10); (b) basal diet plus barley (STARCH, n = 10); (c) basal diet plus Soypass (high protein, HiPROT, n = 11); or (d) no transition management (NoTRANS, n = 9). All cows received the same lactational diet. Blood samples, body weights and condition scores (BCS) were collected weekly. Fertility parameters were monitored using milk progesterone profiles and were not affected by transition diet. Data from all cows were then combined and analysed according to the pattern of post-partum ovarian activity. Cows with low progesterone profiles had significantly lower insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin concentrations accompanied by reduced dry matter intakes (DMIs), BCS and body weight. Cows with prolonged luteal activity (PLA) were older and tended to have lower IGF-I. Analysis based on the calving to conception interval revealed that cows which failed to conceive (9/40) also had reduced IGF-I, BCS and body weight. Fertility was, therefore, decreased in cows which were in poor metabolic status following calving. This was reflected in reduced circulating IGF-I concentrations and compromised both ovarian activity and conception. There was little effect of the transition diets on these parameters. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Many such experiments in personal mobility are ongoing worldwide. They are carried out by coalitions of diverse actors, and are driven by long term and large scale visions of advancing society's sustainability agenda. This paper focuses on the processes of higher-order learning that occur through BSTEs. Based on the conceptual frameworks from theories of organizational learning, policy-oriented learning, and diffusion of innovation, we identify two types of learning: the first type occurs among the participants in the experiment and their immediate professional networks: the second type occurs in the society at large. Both types play a key role in the societal transition towards sustainable mobility systems. Two case studies, in which the Design for Sustainability Group at Technical University of Delft has participated, provide empirical data for the analysis. One case consists of development of a three-wheeled bike-plus vehicle (Mitka); the second case seeks to solve mobility problems on the Dutch island of Texel. We find that higher order learning of the first type occurs among the BSTE participants and beyond. Learning can be facilitated by deployment of structured visioning exercises, by diffusion of ideas among related BSTEs, by innovative couplings of problems and solutions, and by creating links among related experiments. Government agencies, universities and other intellectual entrepreneurs have key roles to play in making that happen. The cases provide much less insights about the second type of learning. Research on the latter is necessary.",,"mobility; sustainability; technological development; technology; transportation; Netherlands",,,,,,"Kemp, R., Schot, J., Hoogma, R., Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: The approach of strategic niche management (1998) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 10 (2), pp. 175-195; Irwin, A., Georg, S., Vergragt, Ph.J., The social management of environmental change (1991) Futures, 26 (3), pp. 323-334; Verheul, H., Vergragt, Ph.J., Social experiments in the development of environmental technology: A bottom-up perspective (1995) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 7 (3), pp. 315-326; Hoogma, R., Kemp, R., Schot, J., Truffer, B., (2002) Experimenting for Sustainable Transport.

Impact Assessment theories assume that causal impact analysis may provide information that contributes to better decision making in complex situations. These are situations where alternative courses of action have complex ramifications for impact. However, so-called rational knowledge is often available through Impact Assessment, but not used in decision making. Explanations can be found in two kinds of logic characterizing collective decision making. First, societal problems are complex and, therefore, multi-rational. Providing more information does not help to reduce complexity or to overcome multi-rationality. Second, the increasing need to co-operate results in high process dynamics, where irrationality and emotions prevail and information is gathered to underpin these 'irrationalities'. At present, Impact Assessment seems to be insufficient to attain the societal transitions that may be necessary for genuine sustainable development. The authors argue that Impact Assessment should incorporate tenable assertions about the logic of the decision-making processes in which the assessments should be used. Only, perhaps, in such circumstances can a more effective process based on multi-rational argumentation and plausibility be achieved. It is the authors' conviction that an improved understanding of multi-rational processes can contribute significantly to new types of Impact Assessment that more effectively support sustainable development.",,,,,,,,"Bartlett, R.V., Kurian, P.A., The theory of environmental Impact Assessment: Implicit models of decision-making (1999) Policy and Politics, 27, pp. 415-434; Van Den Berg, J., Nooteboom, S., (1994) SEA: Existing Methodology, , http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/eia/, Brussels, European Commission/DHV; Brandenburg, A., Nalebuff, B., (1996) Co-opetition, , Doubleday, Broadway Books; Brundlandt, G.H., (1987) Our Common Future, Report of the World Commission on Sustainable Development, , Oxford University Press, New York; Caldwell, L., Implementing through procedure: Impact Assessment and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (1998) Environmental Methods Review: Retooling Impact Assessment for the New Century, pp. 8-14. , A.

The findings of the study refute the notion of large generational differences. Both older and younger people involved in these organizations have many of the same qualities: commitment, concern, energy, interest, and a strong belief in justice. However, differences are evident between those born in the Baby Boom generation and those who identify with Generation X in respect to their motivations to enter social change work, their concerns about the work/personal life divide, and their views of the future.

Key elements of the program include physician education, enrollment of patients with high disease burden who may not be terminally ill, co-management of care with the primary physician, and an advanced practice clinical team that provides comprehensive in-home assessments, a flexible mix of life-prolonging and palliative care that evolves with disease progression, focused education and advance planning, and caregiver support. During a 42-month demonstration, 208 patients were enrolled in the program. Eighty percent had a non-cancer diagnosis; 40% were people of color. After an 8-month follow-up, 44% of the study cohort had died in the program or after transfer to hospice, 51% had been discharged, and 5% remained active. Median length of stay for decedents was 260 days. Preliminary evidence supports the program's feasibility and acceptability to patients, families, physicians, and agency partners. However, the uncertain future of Medicare + Choice and of managed care may jeopardize the program's sustainability. Policymakers and taxpayers will need to determine how to care for the growing number of chronically ill elderly who wish to remain at home as illness advances.

The findings include why current employees joined, their motivations and problems in seeking positions once in the public service, and issues in transition management. The model found that promotion stress and commitment were primary causes for seeking new positions. However, this search favored remaining in the civil service. The model also suggested the importance of supervisory support in addressing a number of career issues. Implications are drawn for meeting challenges including recruiting and retaining the ""new age"" employee, and managing the more calculative relationship between employee and organization.",,,,,,,,"Green, M.E., Beware and prepare: The government workforce of the future (2000) Public Personnel Management, WINTER, pp. 435-444; Mir, A., Mir, R., Mosca, J.B., The new age employee: An exploration of changing employee-organization relations (2002) Public Personnel Management, SUMMER, pp. 187-200. , Ibid; Lamb, C.W., Hair J.F., Jr., McDaniel, C., Faria, A.J., (2002) The Subject is Marketing, Second Canadian Edition, , Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson; Duxbury, L., Dyke, L., Lam, N., (1999) Career Development in the Federal Public Service: Building a World-Class Workforce, , Ottawa: Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat; Lewis, G.B., Frank, S.A., Who wants to work for the government?

We asked if increased effort (up to five years of N fertilization) would shift canopy attributes across the hypothesized threshold. Thirty plots were treated with 0-5 yr of urea addition, and all were followed for 5 yr. Canopies were robust while urea was being added, but Spartina reverted to short stature soon after fertilization ended, supporting R. J. Hobbs and D. A. Norton's concept of an irreversible transition. However, specific outcomes depended on thechoice of response variable (six comparisons), the choice of reference data (initial conditions, same-year data, and pooled data), and the choice of statistical design (repeated measures vs. complete design), indicating the need to assess experiments thoroughly before making strong recommendations for management.","Alternative-state theory; Cordgrass; Fertilization effects; Irreversible transition; Management actions; Nitrogen addition; Restoration outcome, evaluating; Restoration threshold; Spartina foliosa; Statistical design; Wetland restoration, coastal","coastal wetland; degradation; restoration ecology; wetland management; Aves; Spartina; Spartina foliosa",,,,,,"Bowles, M.L., McBride, J.L., Vegetation composition, structure, and chronological change in a decadent midwestern North American savanna remnant (1998) Natural Areas Journal, 18, pp. 14-27; Boyer, K.E., Callaway, J.C., Zedler, J.B., Evaluating the progress of restored cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) marshes: Belowground biomass and tissue nitrogen (2000) Estuaries, 23, pp. 711-721; Boyer, K.E., Zedler, J.B., Damage to cordgrass by scale insects in a constructed salt marsh (1996) Estuaries, 9, pp. 1-12; Boyer, K.E., Zedler, J.B., Effects of nitrogen additions on the vertical structure of a constructed cordgrass marsh (1998) Ecological Applications, 8, pp. 692-705; Carrillo-Garcia, A., Bashan, Y., Bethlenfalvay, G.J., Resource-island soils and the survival of the giant cactus, cardon, of Baja California Sur (2000) Plant and Soil, 218, pp. 207-214; Carrillo-Garcia, A., Bashan, Y., Rivera, E.D., Bethlenfalvay, G.J., Effects of resource-island soils, competition, and inoculation with Azospirillum on survival and growth of Pachycereus pringlei, the giant cactus of the Sonoran Desert (2000) Restoration Ecology, 8, pp. 65-73; Dai, T., Wiegert, R.G., Ramet population dynamics and net aerial primary productivity of Spartina alterniflora (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 276-288; Day, R.W., Quinn, G.P., Comparisons of treatments after an analysis of variance in ecology (1989) Ecological Monographs, 59, pp. 433-463; DeLaune, R.D., Pezeshki, S.R., Relationship of mineral nutrients to growth of Spartina alterniflora in Louisiana salt marshes (1988) Northeast Gulf Science, 10, pp. 55-60; Gallagher, J.L., Effect of an ammonium nitrate pulse on the growth and elemental composition of natural stands of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus (1975) American Journal of Botany, 62, pp. 644-648; Gurevitch, J., Chester S.T., Jr., Analysis of repeated measures experiments (1986) Ecology, 67, pp. 251-255; Hintze, J.L., (2000) NCSS 200 User's Guide, , Number Cruncher Statistical System.

While in 1989 the private sector totalled less than 1 per cent of the GDP, at the end of 1996 more than 70 per cent of the GDP was produced by the private sector. Large-scale privatisation brought companies out of state ownership, but disperse ownership and lack of regulations created an extremely soft management environment. Since 1995 investment funds have started to reorganise their portfolio and more and more companies have undertaken the task of restructuralisation to become competitive. Though a considerable amount of data is still lacking, it can be concluded that the improvement in the profitability of the surveyed enterprises was due to improvements in corporate governance.","Corporate governance; Czech Republic; Investment funds; Privatization; Transition management",,,,,,,"Aghion, P., Blanchard, O., Burgess, R., The behaviour of state firms in Eastern Europe, pre-privatisation (1994) European Economic Review, 38, pp. 1327-1349; Aghion, P., Blanchard, O., Carlin, W., The economics of enterprise restructuring in Central and Eastern Europe (1994) CEPR Discussion Paper No. 1058, 1058. , CEPR, London; Blanchard, O., Dombusch, R., Krugman, P., Layard, R., Summers, L., (1991) Reform in Eastern Europe, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Claessens, S., Djankov, S., Pohl, G., Ownership and corporate governance: Evidence from the Czech Republic (1997) Policy Research Working Paper No. 1737, 1737. , The World Bank, Washington, DC; Coffee, J., Institutional investors in transition economies: Lessons from the Czech experience (1996) Corporate Governance in Central Europe and Russia, 1, pp. 111-186. , Frydman, R., Gray, C.W. and Rapaczynski, A.

From an economic point of view, the central question at this transition is whether the change in property rights regimes significantly and benevolently affects the governing structure of the assets in question. This short essay attempts to provide a framework which is theoretical enough to guide meaningful questions, and open and naïve enough not to preclude relevant insight. The contribution of this article consists in a theoretically driven questionnaire which, based on the current state of the property rights theory of the firm, the relevant aspects of law and economics as well as financial economics, tries to elicit scholarly information about issues of institutional detail ultimately, the aim is to show how the different approaches to mass privatization can be evaluated from the point of view of creating viable governing structures.","Corporate governance; Privatization; Property rights; Rent reviews; Transition management",,,,,,,"Nunnenkamp, P., The German model of corporate governance: Basic features, critical issues and applicability to transition economies (1995) Kiel Working Paper, 713","Backhaus, J.G.; Universität Erfurt, Erfurt, Thuringia, Germany",,,,,,,,01443585,,,,,"English","Journal of Economic Studies",Review,Scopus

Box 217, 7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands","This paper addresses the question of how technological transitions (TT) come about? Are there particular patterns and mechanisms in transition processes? TT are defined as major, long-term technological changes in the way societal functions are fulfilled. TT do not only involve changes in technology, but also changes in user practices, regulation, industrial networks, infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture. This paper practices 'appreciative theory' [R.R. Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Bellknap Press, Cambridge, MA, 1982] and brings together insights from evolutionary economics and technology studies. This results in a multi-level perspective on TT where two views of the evolution are combined: (i) evolution as a process of variation, selection and retention, (ii) evolution as a process of unfolding and reconfiguration. The perspective is empirically illustrated with a qualitative longitudinal case-study, the transition from sailing ships to steamships, 1780-1900. Three particular mechanisms in TT are described: niche-cumulation, technological add-on and hybridisation, riding along with market growth. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The study has illuminated the challenges of managing the surprisingly difficult transition from R&D project to an operating unit in the eight of the 12 projects that reached transition. A substantial ""readiness gap"" existed between the project teams and the receiving business units. The challenges have been captured in the form of ten critical questions that must be addressed before a project can be successfully transitioned. Based on an analysis of transition practices, the authors identify seven propositions for improving the effectiveness of transition management suggesting the potential usefulness of the following managerial approaches: 1) conducting a transition readiness assessment; 2) assembling a transition team; 3) establishing an oversight board; 4) developing a transition plan; 5) providing transition funding from corporate sources; 6) laying the groundwork for a big market; and 7) engaging senior management champions.","Breakthrough innovation; Discontinuous innovation; Innovation; Project management; Radical innovation; Transition management","Engineering research; Industrial research; Managers; Project management; Breakthrough innovation; Discontinuous innovation; Radical innovation; Transition management; Research and development management",,,,,,"Betz, F., (1993) Strategic Technology Management, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Block, Z., MacMillan, I.C., (1993) Corporate Venturing, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Burgelman, R., Sayles, L., (1986) Inside Corporate Innovation, , New York: Free Press; Cooper, R., The new product process: A decision guide for management (1990) IEEE Eng.

This assumption is an inheritance of the Enlightenment; i.e., the belief that science will automatically lead to a better quality of life. The strive for sustainable development needs an approach towards innovation that can be characterised as society pull: the society has to decide which (balance of) economical, ecological and social goals are to be met. Society pull can be organised by developing shared perspectives for the future, which are inspiring for public and private policy-makers and investors. In this paper this is worked out as transition management: a process approach directing innovation towards sustainable development.

Although the goals of a transition are ultimately chosen by society, governments can play a role in bringing about structural change in a stepwise manner. Their management involves sensitivity to existing dynamics and regular adjustment of goals to overcome the conflict between long-term ambition and short-term concerns. This article uses the example of a transition to a low emission energy supply in the Netherlands to argue that transition management provides a basis for coherence and consistency in public policy and can be the spur to sustainable development.","Evolution; Sustainable development; The Netherlands",,,,,,,,"Maastricht University, Intl.

The overall position of the customers and suppliers is analyzed using the stakeholder theory while the management of the relations is dealt with using three alternative approaches, the mainstream strategic planning approach, the network and the action-experience approach. The findings are based on an empirical study of 172 Russian enterprises. It is found that Russian enterprises do not use strategic planning to any large extent. Financial constraints, the lack of a coherent regulatory framework and imperfect markets make firm managers turn to networking building on experiences from the central planning era. It is also found that networks were instrumental in the fast development of barter trade. However, the networks are weak and unless redefined, are likely to disappear when the financial constraints are overcome. Barter transactions have declined since the financial crisis in August 1998 and following the devaluation of the ruble, producers have experienced new business opportunities, reflected in growing expectations regarding sales and supplies. Given the present context, managers are advised to further develop their networks to encompass additional activities, e.g., product and process development, additional domestic customers and suppliers and perhaps additional foreign partners to enhance their technological capabilities.","Barter; Customer relations; Network; Strategic planning; Supplier relations; Transition management","economic relations; industrial practice; transitional economy; Russian Federation",,,,,,"Aukutsionek, S., Barter: New data and comments (1999) Russian Economic Barometer, 3, pp. 3-16; Aukutsionek, S., Industrial barter in Russia (1998) Communist Economics and Economic Transformation, 10 (2), pp. 179-188; Bim, A.S., (1996) Ownership, Control over the Enterprise, and Strategies of the Stockholders, , IILSA Working paper, WP 96-050.

Although these problems are rampant, proper documentation is lacking. The objective of this study was to reflect the health situation of women in rural Ethiopia. Furthermore, the study attempts to address the socio-demographic and cultural factors that have potential influence on the health of women in the context of a low-income setting. A combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods was utilised. In-depth interviews and a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected women were the main methods employed. The Butajira Rural Health Program demographic surveillance database provided the sampling frame. Heavy workload, lack of access to health services, poverty, traditional practices, poor social status and decision-making power, and lack of access to education were among the highly prevalent socio-cultural factors that potentially affect the health of women in Butajira. Though the majority of the women use traditional healers younger women show more tendency to use health services. No improvement of women's status was perceived by the younger generation compared to the older generation. Female genital mutilation is universal with a strong motivation to its maintenance. Nail polish has replaced the rite of nail-extraction before marriage in the younger generation. As the factors influencing the health of women are multiple and complex a holistic approach should be adopted with emphasis on improving access to health care and education, enhancing social status, and mechanisms to alleviate poverty.

New construction technologies and new building components would allow us to reduce the ecological load of buildings to a fraction of its present value. However, the problem of making our building stock more sustainable is only to a minor extent a technical one. The required change of technologies can only be managed by simultaneously taking into account technical potentials and their social context. Social studies of technology, with their focus on the construction of technologies as an interactive effort of various actors and on the inseparability of the social and technical side of sociotechnical systems provide a perspective to better understand the processes involved in the construction and dissemination of sustainable buildings. A number of strategies to manage technical change towards sustainability will be discussed: better integration of various actors at the supply side, shift to a market for innovative and ecological building services, improvement of user-producer relationships and integration of consumers into the innovation process.",,"building code; construction industry; sustainable development; technological development",,,,,,"Fischer-Kowalski, M., Haberl, H., Huttler, W., Payerl, H., Schandl, H., Winiwarter, V., Zangerl-Weisz, H., (1997) Gesellschaftlicher Stoffwechsel Und Kolonisierung Von Natur: Ein Versuch in Sozialer Ökologie, , Amsterdam, Oversees Publisher Association; Griebhammer, R., Buchert, M., (1996) Nachhaltige Entwicklung Und Stoffstrommanagement Am Bau, , Werkstattreihe No. 96, Öko-Institut e.V., Freiburg; Hüttler, W., (1996) Materialfluβrechnung Österreich.

Successful electronic commerce activities depend on the partners involved in the product or service being delivered. Firms able to communicate with their partners electronically for procurement, sales, or supply chain management have become what many call clicks-and-mortar companies. An empirically based technological model that helps organizations understand the requirements of moving towards the seamless integration of intra- and inter-organizational processes is proposed. This five-wave transitional model accompanies key decision-makers through progressive steps that correspond to different business-to-business e-commerce needs and specifications. As organizations move along these technological waves, we can witness the gradual opening-up of new opportunities for carrying out business. This paper presents the model, its requirements and its technological and organizational underpinnings.

Yet studies find that more than 80 percent of corporate combinations fail to achieve projected financial, strategic, and operational synergies. Obviously, the price paid, choice of partners, clarity of strategy, and compatibility of cultures are important factors in failure versus success. Based on the authors' experience in over 50 combinations, another success factor is the way the transition is organized and managed. This article describes key considerations and pitfalls in designing and running an effective transition structure. A transition structure is a forum in which executives from combining companies can study and plan for the ways that promised objectives can be realized in practice. It is a temporary but formal arrangement whose members represent every area of the two companies and have joint input into the integration of businesses. It also promotes ""relationship building"" between the two sides. A well-run transition structure ensures that in-depth thinking and informed decisions go into creating the new operation while the demands of running the day-today business are still met.

This article represents my self-reflection as a nursing unit manager who personally experienced survivor sickness and witnessed its impact on the unit staff that I was leading at the time. The work of Noer (1993) is explored to clarify the syndrome and describe how the nursing staff and I manifested the syndrome. The writings of Bridges (1991), Brockner (1992) and Noer (1993) provide timely and relevant insights into managing the impact of layoffs and downsizing on those left behind to carry on. Noer (1993) sees the adaptation to the change as the ability to make the psychological shift from the old business paradigm that perpetuated codependency to the new business paradigm of fostering empowered employees. Bridges (1991) takes us a step further in making this psychological shift to adapt to the new work environment by providing a three phase process he calls transitions.

It focuses on project-level mechanisms for the generation of knowledge through experimentation and for its accumulation through individual experience. It proposes a model that links these mechanisms to effectiveness in the management of revolutionary and evolutionary development approaches. This argument is tested with data describing projects conducted by all major competitors in the semiconductor industry. Each project was aimed at a technological transition, defined as the introduction of a major new generation of process technology. The analysis shows substantial differences among competitors in the approach taken (i.e., evolutionary vs. revolutionary) and results achieved. Additionally, it shows that individual organizations can migrate, over time, from evolution to revolution and vice versa. The analysis further indicates that accumulating experience and generating knowledge through experimentation are significantly associated with project performance. While product performance improvement through revolution is associated with research experience and with parallel experimentation capacity, improvement through evolution is associated with project experience and minimum experimental iteration time.",,"Electronics industry; Product development; Semiconductor device manufacture; Strategic planning; Technological transitions; Industrial management",,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Clark, K.B., Behind the learning curve: A sketch of the learning process (1991) Management Sci., 37 (3), pp. 267-281; Alexander, C., (1964) Notes on the Synthesis of Form, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Allen, T.J., (1977) Managing the Flow of Technology, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Hauptman, O., The influence of communication technologies on organizational structure (1987) Comm.

The transition team and the organization's associated management structure must answer twelve critical questions before a project can be successfully transitioned.

To answer this question, this paper examines cinema's integration of new technologies. It proposes that nineteenth-century institutions such as the insurance industry and the railroad provide cinema with a strategic model for choosing and regulating new cinematic technologies. To investigate this hypothesis, the paper overlays film history's three most important technological transitions: cinema's 'invention' in 1895, sound's standardisation in the 1920s, and the contemporary integration of computer-generated images (CGI).

They would tend to suggest that the replacement of one way of life by another was far from rapid, abrupt or simple, and they call into question the ""out of Africa"" invasionist scenario. Although Iberia seems to have been a ""bridge"" between Africa and the rest of Europe during certain times (notably at the time of the first colonization(s) of Europe, perhaps in the late Lower Pleistocene, as suggested by the discoveries at Atapuerca), at other times it seems to have been cut off from Africa. Despite the presence of Aurignacian technology in Cantabria and Catalonia since 40 kya, the continued persistence of Neanderthals and of Mousterian technology for over 10 ky in southern Iberia would seem to belie the superiority and African origin of upper palaeolithic Cro-Magnon. Furthermore, even in northern Spain, where the taxonomic identity of the makers of the early Aurignacian remains unknown, the nature of the technological transition was variable: abrupt in Catalonia and gradual in Cantabria. Added to the rest of the record, which includes Neanderthals apparently making Chatelperronian tools in France, Szeletian tools in Hungary and later Aurignacian tools in Croatia, a complete lack of any fossils in definite association with early Aurignacian anywhere, evidence of subsistence and technological change during the Mousterian in certain regions of Europe, scant evidence for cultural differentiation between Neanderthals and early anatomically modern humans (Skhul & Qafzeh) in Israel, growing (albeit limited) evidence for middle palaeolithic artistic or ornamental activity, and evidence for considerable, on-going change in technology and subsistence during the upper palaeolithic, the Iberian record strongly argues for a long, uneven transition from middle to upper palaeolithic lifeways- not a simple, abrupt invasion of Europe out of Africa.","Homo sapiens sapiens; Iberia; Middle palaeolithic; Neanderthal; Portugal; Spain; Upper palaeolithic",,,,,,,"Allsworth-Jones, P., Les industries à pointes foliacées d'Europe centrale (1990) Mémoires du Musée de Préhistoire d'Ile de France, 3, pp. 79-97. , (C.

It commences with an overview of societies which are recognised as being in transition. The economic foundations of the transition from traditional to modern (and post-modem societies) will be emphasised. This will be followed by an examination of the nutrition problems and food habits associated with transitional societies. The public health context of such nutritional problems will also be described. Comparisons will be made between the food beliefs and habits held , in traditional societies and those in transitional, modern and post-modern societies. It will be argued that nutritional and medical beliefs have come to play more extensive roles in non-traditional societies, most probably through the mass media. Changes in personal values associated with societal transition will be described in relation to the pursuit of luxury foods. Finally, some of the responses to the nutritional problems of transitional societies will be described. The essential roles of government and non-govemment organisations in moderating harmful effects of the global economy will be elucidated. It will be argued that the success of nutrition interventions such as food-based dietary guideline policies depend on the development of effective national and local social organisations.","Food habits; Nutrition; Transitional societies",,,,,,,"McMichael, A.J., (1993) Planetary Overload: Global Environmental Change and the Health of the Human Species, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; McMichael, P., (1996) Development and Social Change: A Global Perspective, , Thousand Oaks, California: Pine Forge; Kennedy, P., (1993) Preparing for the Twenty-first Century, , London: Harper Collins; Popkin, B.M., The nutrition transition in low-income countries: An emerging crisis (1994) Nutr Rev, 52, pp. 285-298; Drewnowski, A., Popkin, B.M., The nutrition transition: New trends in the global diet (1997) Nutr Rev, 55, pp. 31-43; Hodge, A.M., Zimmet, P.Z., The epidemiology of obesity (1994) Clin Endocrinol Metab, 8, pp. 577-599; MacIntyre, A., (1984) After Virtue, 2nd Edn., , Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press; Tansey, G., Worsley, T., (1995) The Food System: A Guide, , London: Earthscan; Tupoulahi, C.S., (1997) The Socio-cultural Antecedents of Obesity in Tonga, , PhD thesis, Flinders University of South Australia; Stunkard, A.J., Socio-economic status and obesity (1996) The Origins and Consequences of Obesity Ciba Foundation Symposium, 201, pp. 174-187. , Wiley J, ed.

The structure of the Middle Paleolithic record of the Lower Nile Valley and adjacent deserts, a key region in the Out-of-Africa model, is examined. On the basis of the present database two archaeological complexes can be established: the Nubian complex and the Lower Nile Valley complex. In the Nubian complex, which appears in the Lower Nile Valley during the late Middle Pleistocene and coexists with a Lower Nile Valley complex issuing from the local Acheulean, hunting was a major subsistence strategy. From the last interglacial on the Nubian complex is found beyond the valley, whereas the Lower Nile Valley complex remains restricted to its riverine environment. Here, a technological transition to an Upper Palaeolithic type of production is attested as a punctuated event around 40,000 years ago at the latest. The appearance of the Nubian complex in the northern reaches of the Nile Valley would seem to correspond to the Out-of-Africa model of dispersal. However, the general reconstruction of behavioural repertoires from archaeological evidence does not satisfactorily correspond to the patterning expected according to either that model or its alternative. It is concluded that the Middle Palaeolithic record of Northeast Africa is the product of different populations with modern behavioural capacities. Their particular organisations of the subsistence domain and even their migrations are revealed in archaeological patterns of variability and change, but the record holds no evidence of anatomical constraints on this capacity for modern behaviour or of the social mechanisms by which it might have been transmitted. © 1998 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

Early territories in Cornwall reflected relatively simple social structures of economic resource exploitation and personal spheres of power, very much based around kinship patterns. As transitions in society produced a more sophisticated hierarchical network of control and income generation through dues and tax, so the territorial strategy grew more complex. This resulted in the development of a territorialised state structure. Phenomena were now seen in relation to territorial units rather than in relation to social groups, and each portion of land wad delineated and locked into a terrirotiral hierarchy controlled from above. Investigation is undertaken through analysis of early ecclesiastical and judicial organisation in west Cornwall, and the vestiges of very early forms of landscape arrangement are explored. The mechanisms of control and exploitation, developed before the Norman conqeust, gave territorial expression to previous socially recognised institutions and it is within the context of these developments that later territories should be understood.",,"landscape history; social trends; territorial structure; UK, England, Cornwall",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01433768,,,,,"English","Landscape History",Article,Scopus

The management of IGMDP took enormous risk and proceeded with the concurrent development of the technology, the product, as well as the establishment of production facilities. During the implementation of this concurrent development and production process, a number of hurdles have been encountered which further led to the development of new ideas, tools and techniques to realize the weapon systems in shorter time frames. The net result of these efforts is not only the saving in time from the design of weapon systems to their induction, but also the build-up in technological confidence that swept through all those organizations that participated in this program. This paper presents the experiences of the Indian Guided Missile Programme in implementing the various concurrent engineering practices.","Concurrent engineering; Consortia; Design reviews; Indian Guided Missile Programme; Investment risk; Multi-functional teams; Organizational culture; Pre-production reviews; Program management; Technical uncertainties; Technology transfer; Transition management","Military applications; Ordnance; Process engineering; Project management; Technology transfer; Transition management; Concurrent engineering",,,,,,"De Young, H.G., Managing technology at warp speed (1991) Electronic Business, pp. 53-57. , January; Evanczuk, S., Back-end engineering moves to the front (1989) High Performance Systems, pp. 18-25. , November; Goldsteim, M.L., Just managing won't be enough (1988) Industry Week, p. 21. , April; Kanter, R.M., The new managerial work (1989) Harvard Business Review, pp. 85-92. , November-December; Kerzner, H., The impact of concurrent engineering upon project management (1993) Project Dynamics, pp. 8-22. , July-September; Kottrer, J.P., What leaders really do (1990) Harvard Business Review, pp. 103-111. , May-June; McKinnis, C., Convair goes concurrent (1991) Computer-Aided Engineering, pp. 18-27. , February; Richardson, K.D., Implementing concurrent engineering (1991) Proceedings of the University of Southern California Concurrent Engineering Conference, pp. 1-14. , January; Rosemblatt, A., Watson, G.F., Concurrent engineering (1991) IEEE Spectrum, pp. 22-37. , July; Thryft, A.R., Getting concurrent no simple task (1991) Computer Design, p. 1. , March; Winner, R.I., (1988) The Role of Concurrent Engineering in Weapons Systems Acquisition, , Alexandria, VA: Institute for Defence Analysis","Pillai, A.S.; Intgd.

The aim of this study was to provide ergonomic intervention to assist personnel to reduce the potential for human error and optimise working conditions during a gas plant control room refurbishment. The terms of reference were; to identify factors likely to interfere with operators performance during the transition to a new layout and their operational procedures, to assist in altering operational practice and decision making during this period where necessary, and assess the effectiveness of any changes recommended. The continually changing work situation required client/consultant collaboration, staff support and identification of problems as they arose. Action research was adopted as the basic methodological approach. Preliminary investigations identified factors which might interfere with operators' performance. Structured aids were developed, and technical advice given, together with ongoing ergonomic input (feedback and on-site support). The structured aids proved to be of benefit although the modernisation process was underway before the start of this study. The technical advice offered was judged to be beneficial by senior management and project staff.

These systems were developed to overcome many of the climatic constraints that beset previous attempts at cropping in the region. However, difficulties in the timing of farm operations also contributed to past failures. No analysis of the operational aspects of ley farming had been made; this was the objective of this paper. During the transition between wet and dry seasons rainfall is extremely variable. These periods were shown to be the most critical time for operations in ley farming systems. During the dry-wet transition, management of ley pastures is very difficult because pastures must provide grazing for livestock as well as sufficient soil cover for timely sowing of a following crop. Legume pastures have reduced grazing value at this time due to spoilage by early rain. Similarly, during the wet-dry transition annual pastures must be allowed to set seed at a time when crops are yet to be harvested and stubbles are not available for grazing. It was suggested that including separate paddocks of perennial pasture could reduce the demand on annual pastures during the seasonal transitions. A limited number of days to sow a crop combined with severe yield penalties for late sowing restrict the area that can be sown in any season. Sowing opportunities were determined for 3 locations in the Northern Territory. No-tillage was shown to increase the potential number of sowing days. However, the time available to apply glyphosate before sowing using no-tillage was confined to the morning due to risk of afternoon rainshowers reducing efficacy. The number of seasons where a particular crop or cultivar could not be sown was independent of the method of tillage. The wet-dry transition was shown to be important for harvest operations. Our analysis of 3 sites in the Northern Territory suggests that for mungbean and sorghum, later maturity combined with prompt harvest will reduce the risk of poor seed quality due to weathering and could permit earlier sowing. However, for sorghum, an economic assessment of these practices required research that can quantify the interaction between sowing date, time-to-maturity and grain yield.",,"legume; ley farming; pasture; semi-arid environment; Australia, (North); Australia, Northern Territory; Fabaceae",,,,,,"Andrews, C.H., Preharvest environment: Weathering (1982) Soybean Seed Quality and Stand Establishment, pp. 19-25. , INTSOY Series No. 22.

The first is not borne out by historical experience, and the latter two do not explain why greater affluence generally leads to lower rates of population growth. It is argued here that the crucial population characteristic is density. Rising densities from a low base facilitate more productive agriculture and greater specialization and exchange within a society, as Boserup (1965) pointed out. This leads to increased wealth but also to higher costs for education and land. This provides a link to Caldwell's (1976) explanation of changing attitudes to family size: at low densities in simple societies benefits from children exceed costs, while at higher densities in complex societies costs exceed benefits. The changes in societies and economies are illustrated by a Kenyan case study. -from Author",,"Boserup; developing country; economic growth; family size; income; income growth; population density; population growth; societal transition; Kenya",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English","Development & Change",,Scopus

Omran, the epidemiologist, launched the concepts the epidemic transition and the demographic transition. Assuming that the epidemic and demographic structures of all preindustrial societies were similar, Omran attached these concepts to the epidemic and demographic transitions of the nineteenth century. He indicated that these were the only epidemic and demographic transitions in history. In this paper, it is argued that this assertion is untenable. Historically, there have been many societal transitions implying concurrent and interactive epidemic and demographic transitions. Two major historical events have been selected for illustrative purposes. The emergence of the western demographic system and the advent of plague in 1347 had dramatic impacts on epidemic and demographic conditions. Successful combat of plague, first in Italy, was organized with increasing efficiency from the second half of the fifteenth century on the basis of miasmatic-contagionist epidemiological notions. The antiepidemic organizations developed in this combat were efficient also against most other important epidemic diseases.

While this concept is fairly new in dentistry, it is not new in other commercial enterprises. Business managers and owners have known for decades that growth stagnates after a period of time. At that point, a new infusion of energy and a reformation of the business's objectives and methods are needed to launch forward into the next phase of growth. Transition management in dentistry represents periods of growth that are followed by saturation and a comparatively rapid changeover to a new practice form. Saturation occurs when the clinical capacity of a practice is exceeded by the needs of a growing patient base. The key transitions in the career of a dentist are those from school to practising, and practising to retirement. A great number of dentists (due to low motivation, the comfort level or poor management skills) never reach the saturation point during their practising career. For these dentists, starting out and retirement are the only transitions that will ever apply to them. Dentists evaluating transition options must first identify which career stage they belong to since their objectives will be different at each stage. Dentists in the growth phase should focus on practice management and achieving saturation before attempting a transition. Since transitions like start-up, retirement, partnerships, associateships and buy-ins have pivotal roles in the life cycle of a practice, transitions must be managed carefully to achieve successful results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,"article; human; life event; lifestyle; management; organization and management; productivity; time management; Efficiency; Human; Life Change Events; Life Style; Practice Management, Dental; Time Management",,,,,,,"Manji, I.",,,,,,,,07098936,,,,8252446,"English","Journal (Canadian Dental Association)",Article,Scopus

Designed to be compatible with human requirements, some functional, others emotional and psychological, the candlestick model proves more susceptible to psychocultural than to purely functional analysis. Hints of human physiology in design provide an interpretive clue of importance. Visits at a distance were both made plausible and dramatized to the user through a process of surrogacy or displacement; sympathy, even complicity, were through the illusion that one spoke to the machine instead of through it. The phone set's gaze naturalized (and rationalized) the apparent solipsism of conversation with an absent other. Its form served to compensate for what telephony itself could not provide, or could provide only in metaphor. Harmonious organic lines in combination with the anonymous female voice of the operator played their part in softening a technological transition, suggesting that intimacy in telephone communication might reside in a familiarity with the machine itself. In actuality, however, automatic telephones alienated intimacy as thoroughly as they ensured it. Though evidence of this ambiguity is discernible throughout the candlestick's design, the model's form provided reassurance, through organic contour and suggestions of familiar ritual, that touch was possible, even at a distance. © 1990.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0160791X,,,,,"English","Technology in Society",Article,Scopus

A model that may aid in conceptualizing various technology strategies is presented. Two generic management of technology problems, technology transition and technology transfer, are presented and analysed. Two empirical case illustrations are given. One case analyzes how the Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson managed its successful technological transition from old, electro-mechanical switching technology to new telephone exchanges based on SPC (stored program control) and digital signal processing. The other case analyzes how the Swedish auto-and aerospace company Saab-Scania has attempted to manage technology transfer internally. From each case a number of managerial lessons could be learnt regarding each of the two generic problems in managing technology in multi-technology corporations. In addition, some implications for the theory of firm and industrial organization could be drawn, based on the assumption that managerial development (or learning) takes place regarding technological development. Thereby the conventional view on innovation by invasion and creative destruction is challenged and the old Schumpeter view is qualified. Finally, in the appendix, the empirical relevance of MTCs are discussed. Based on data from the 24 biggest R&D spenders in Sweden, the association between growth, product diversification and technological diversification has been analyzed. © 1990.",,,,,,,,,"Granstrand, O.; Chalmers University of Technology, Department of Industrial Management, S-412 96 Göteborg, Sweden",,,,,,,,00487333,,REPYB,,,"English","Research Policy",Article,Scopus

While much of the data and experience has been accumulated for technical organizations in private practice, the principles are applicable to institutional and public technical organizations as well. Two specific changes are thought necessary as a scientist develops into a professional manager in a growing organization. First, the leader's relationship with the product or service must change from direct to indirect involvement. The orientation changes from technical problem-solving and control to leading and teaching others to solve the technical problems and deal directly with projects. Second, as the organization grows, its leaders must recognize and support the unpopular position that more formal policies and procedures are necessary. The author also considers how a technical leader's time may change as an organization grows in terms of operations, human resources, financial management, planning, and marketing.",,"MANAGEMENT - Research and Development Application; ENGINEERING PROFESSION; RD&E MANAGEMENT; TECHNICAL LEADER; FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT; GROWTH CRITERIA; LEADERSHIP TRANSITION; MANAGEMENT TIME DISTRIBUTION; PERSONALITY-INTEREST PROFILE; TECHNICAL CAREER EVOLUTION; ENGINEERING; MANAGEMENT SCIENCE",,,,,,,"Peck, W.F.; Technical Management Consultants, Inc, Atlanta, GA, USA, Technical Management Consultants Inc, Atlanta, GA, USA",,"AIChE, New York, NY, USA;American Soc for Engineering Management, Rolla, MO, USA;ASME, New York, NY, USA;Chinese Soc of Astronautics & Aeronautics, Beijing, China;IEEE, New York, NY, USA;et al","American Soc for Engineering Management, Rolla, MO, USA","Proceedings - First International Conference on Engineering Management, '86 ICEM.",,"Arlington, VA, USA",9707,,,,,,"English",[No source information available],Conference Paper,Scopus

In the poor developing country launching upon both simultaneously, the agrarian question bifurcates into two dichotomous sets of issues. The first concerns the instrumentality of the agricultural sector in assisting industrialization through the provision of investible resources which the nascent industrial sector cannot generate from within or elsewhere. The second set treats the rural sector not as the continued object of exploitation in the form of primitive socialist accumulation, but rather as the subject of socialist development. The two are interdependent, but in the context of a range of observable socialist industrialization strategies, also frequently incompatible. It is argued that according primacy to accelerated industrial growth generates inter-sectoral imbalances which are resolved through the adoption of selective commoditization and institutional policies, especially in the rural sector, which divert the trajectory of societal transition away from any socialist direction.

Empirically, it appears that few corporations are able to survive discontinuities. They either lose market share, money or their independence. Despite the importance of the discontinuity problem for top management, few have done much to better anticipate and deal with these increasingly frequent events. They act as if they assume that there is nothing that can be done. The problem appears to be one of misplaced faith in some conventional assumptions about what it takes to succeed. The author examines these assumptions, particularly those dealing with the supposed advantages of defenders, and pinpoints their errors. This knowledge then leads to positive solutions that hopefully, in turn, will lead to increased success for some of our most important companies. © 1986.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0160791X,,,,,"English","Technology in Society",Article,Scopus
